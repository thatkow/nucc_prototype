        "description": "We're teaming us with Sydney Speleological Society (SSS) to run a trip to Walli\\, an underappreciated karst area near Canowindra\\, north of Canberra. The caves are on private property so numbers are strictly capped at 10 people and best behaviour is expecteded.\\n\\nThis area has gone unvisited by NUCC for a very\\, very long time\\, so this trip will be a great opportunity to experience the area for the first time! There are both horizontal and vertical caves at Walli so SRT skills are highly recommended. \\n\\nThis trip is beginner-intermediate.\\n\\nYou will need: \\n- Estimated $40 trip fee ($10 kit\\, $30 fuel)\\n- Camping equipment (sleeping bag\\, sleeping mat\\, pillow\\, cooking gear etc.) (shout out if you need to borrow anything and we can make arrangements)\\n- 8x AA batteriesif you're using the club headtorches\\n- Food for two days (we may dinner at the put on the Friday night)\\n- Snacks (non-crumbly)\\, drinks and a wattlebottle\\n- Caving kit (trog suit\\, gloves\\, knee pads\\, helmet\\, headtorch etc.) \\n- Clothes to cave in and appropriate shoes (gumboots are great)\\n- Spare warm clothes to wear at night\\n- Raincoat\\n\\nAs always\\, NUCC will have cavepacks\\, SRT kits\\, helmets\\, headtorches\\, rigging gear\\, overalls and gloves available to borrow. \\n\\n(For transparency\\, cover photo is not Walli but Colong. We have no photos of Walli since we have not been)\\n\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/2035462730521375/",

        "title": "Yarrangobilly Caving",
        "description": "Hi everyone\\, over the weekend of the 27-28th September\\, we’ll be having a trip up to Yarrangobilly Caves (Yagby) in the Snowy Mountains. Yagby is utterly scenic- beautiful plains\\, majestic forest\\, mountain rivers\\, and the caves are absolutely fantastic! Yagby has some of the best caves in NSW\\, as they’re sporty\\, mostly horizontal\\, have streamways\\, and oodles of cave formations. We’re still in the colder part of the year in the High Country\\, so be prepared for temperatures under 0*C at night\\, and there's a chance (not high) of snow during the daytime. \\n\\nFor the trip\\, we’ll be staying at the Yarrangobilly Village Campground\\, in Cotterills Cottage. This is a joint trip with VSA\\, HCG\\, and maybe SUSS\\, so there'll be lots of other cavers around too. It's a great opportunity to meet some cavers from other clubs! Cotterills Cottage is the old post-office for the area\\, and provides a good covered location to set up camp. The campground attached to it is right next to a river\\, and has fireplaces and pit loos. I'll be heading down to Yagby Friday\\, and coming back on Monday\\, but there'll probably be people coming just for the weekend too. We'll sort the final times out amongst the group. \\n\\nThis will not be a beginner trip- you will need to have been on several trips previously to come\\, as several of the caves we're likely to visit are fragile\\, or long days. Getting to the caves usually involves a steep\\, off track bushbash\\, and a couple of the caves are quite long and requiring familiarity with moving through a cave environment. Several of the caves we're visiting are also vertical caves\\, so while being able to do SRT is not compulsory for this trip\\, being comfortable with rebelays and changeovers is recommended.\\n\\nYou will have to be a member of NUCC or another ASF club to come. Please let me know if you have a car and are willing to drive for the trip. Due to permit conditions\\, we have a tentative limit of 8p on the trip (unless a second leader comes). Please discuss coming with me prior to signing up. \\n\\nYou will need: \\n- Estimated $45 trip fee ($5 kit\\, $45 fuel)\\; plus there's a possibility of a pub dinner on the way there or back (or maybe even in Talbingo one night with the VSA people staying there)\\n- Camping equipment (sleeping bag\\, sleeping mat\\, camp seat\\, pillow\\, cooking gear etc): if you don’t have it\\, some other members might have stuff they can lend you\\, but you’ll need to ask. You do not need a tent for this trip\\, unless you're planning to camp outside of Cotterills Cottage. \\n- 8xAA batteries (suggest 12xAA batteries if you're staying Fri-Mon) if you're using the club headtorches\\n- Food for however many days you're staying\\, including lunches that can go caving with you (one possible cave is a 6h through-trip)\\n- Snacks\\, drinks\\, and any alcohol you want for the evening\\n- Non-crumbly snacks and a waterbottle to take underground\\n- Any personal caving kit you want to bring (gloves are STRONGLY recommended\\, as the rock can be cold and wet and sharp)\\n- Several sets of clothes to cave in (thermals can be nice at Yagby) and appropriate shoes (recommend gumboots)\\n- Spare warm clothes to wear at night\\, and in the cars\\n- A jumper\\, raincoat\\, beanie\\, warm gloves\\, and thermals (it can get very cold at Yagby at night!)\\n- Detrog gear (a compact\\, clean set of clothes and shoes to take into the cave with you\\, plus a bag to put it all in\\; reefwalkers or sandals are great)\\n\\nAs always\\, NUCC will have cavepacks\\, SRT kits\\, helmets\\, headtorches\\, rigging gear\\, some overalls and gloves (but the overalls are starting to get pretty ratty). We also do have some camping gear\\, but you’re probably better off borrowing it from other members.\\n\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/1800741670805728/",
