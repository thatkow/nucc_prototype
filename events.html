    "body": "FROM THE ARCHIVES: Test website-ising a long past NUCC trip...\n\nAnother one of NUCC's big end of year trips. This time, it saw us going to Jenolan to meet up with SUSS for a couple of days of caving in Barralong (helping dive trips), Wiburds and Mammoth (survey work and fun); then heading up north to Kempsey, where we checked out caves in and around the Kookaburra and Moparabah areas. A little side trip up to Nimbin, through Armidale, and a stop off at Abercrombie caves on the way back finished off the journey.\n\n**Day 1 (Canberra – Jenolan) Sunday 30/11**\n\nAfter getting together at Olaf’s place and having a late lunch, left Canberra about 2:30pm to reach Jenolan by sunset. Made it to Caver’s Cottage and the SUSSlings.\n\n**Day 2 (Jenolan: Barralong/Wiburds) Monday 1/12**\n\nIain and Olaf with Kier, Rod, Mark and Simon (SUSS) to help carry dive gear into Barralong Cave. Visited all the Oolite pools at the rear end of the cave. Andrew, Mel, Peta and Steven together with Ian (SUSS) into Wiburds to help with the survey work. According to the rumours, Peta got stuck in the cave for between 40 minutes and 2 hours (depending on who the story is told to ;-), needing to be chiselled out of the rocks that she had become wedged in.\n\n    \n**Day 3 (Jenolan: Grand Arch/Mammoth) Tuesday 2/12**\n\nA rest day for all except Steven, who joined a SUSS scaling pole expedition into Mammoth cave. The rest of us lazed about Jenolan Village, and walked in the surrounding area. Peta left us in the morning to return to Canberra for a day.\n     \n**Day 4 (Jenolan: Barralong) Wednesday 3/12**\n\nAnother dive trip into Barralong. This time we all went in, making the party size 10. Got a small amount of time to take some pictures in Barralong. Ran into a wedding ceremony on the way out of the show-cave leading out of Barralong.\n  \n    \n**Day 5 (Jenolan: Show Caves/Mammoth) Thursday 4/12**\n\nAnother lazy day for most, as we waited for Peta to return. Iain and Olaf visited the Show-cave system to investigate water quality after the recent dive work and rain. All of us ventured into Mammoth cave in the afternoon to check out Grinning Monster Lake, Lower River and Oolite chamber.\n\n**Day 6 (Jenolan – South West Rocks) Friday 5/12**\n\nLong drive up to South West Rocks, via Sydney, Newcastle, and Kempsey. Reached Phil Lardner’s (KSS) place around 10:00pm, with Mel and Peta arriving sometime after 11:30 as they had visited a friend in Newcastle on the way.\n \n**Day 7 (South West Rocks – Kookaburra) Saturday 6/12**\n\nDrive out to Kookaburra, where we stayed at the Scout Hut, lighting the stove in the evening for warmth, then celebrating Andrew’s 50th Birthday (three weeks prematurely) with some sparklers and chocolate cake.\n   \n**Day 8 (Kookaburra) Sunday 7/12**\n\nA rest day in the Hut, due to unwelcoming weather. Played 500, Checkers and Backgammon. Mel, Peta, Steve and Olaf walked along Carrai Road in the evening.\n   \n  \n**Day 9 (Kookaburra: Rainforest Walk - Kempsey) Monday 8/12**\n\nTook the opportunity presented by the good weather to try and find River, Crystal and Fenner Caves in the thick rainforest north of Kookaburra. Turned out to be a serious bush-bash with no caves found. Even the GPS had trouble finding satellites in the dense bush! Next time we’ll know to bring along local trackers!\n\nMel, Peta, Steve and Olaf drove to South West Rocks in the evening, stopping a road side diner for dinner as everything else was shut by the time we got there. Stayed at the Trial Bay Goal Camping area for the night.\n  \n**Day 10 (Kempsey - Kookaburra) Tuesday 9/12**\n\nDropped Peta off at the train station in the morning, then got some breakfast at a local café. Headed back to Kookaburra after refilling the gas bottles and buying supplies. Ended up going for a drive up to Mary’s View Lookout just as Andrew and Iain were coming back from there.\n\n**Day 11 (Kookaburra) Wednesday 10/12**\n\nDecided to try and find caves in the more open country around Haydonville. Found numerous holes in and around the Natural Arch.   \n \n**Day 12 (Kookaburra - Moparabah) Thursday 11/12**\n\nDrive down to Moparabah after cleaning the hut at Kookabarra. Found the temperature in the lower plains somewhat higher, and more humid. Set up tents and tarps just before the rain started. Iain and Mel drove separately to Kempsey, leaving the empty jerry cans behind. Thus Andrew and Steve decided to head out to Willawarrin, in order to fill them. Everyone returned in the evening, with Mel bringing back some pizza after being freaked out by the locals in Kempsey.\n\n**Day 13 (Moparabah) Friday 12/12**\n\nSpent most of the day inside Moparabah cave, sheltered from the heat of the outside world. Had a good time exploring many passageways, and coming across numerous bats.\nIn search of the elusive exit passage...\n     \n \n**Day 14 (Moparabah - Armidale) Saturday 13/12**\n\nAfter packing up, swimming in the river and eating lunch at Willawarrin pub (the chips at the local take-away were really good), we each headed in different ways; Steven and Iain were headed up north to Nimbin, in order to see the commune of Tuntabul. Andrew, Mel and Olaf headed towards Armidale, to find Mel’s relatives. Ended up not finding them, but finding dinner instead at a local pub.\n   \n**Day 15 (Armidale - Nimbin) Sunday 14/12**\n\nAfter a swim in the caravan park pool, said out farewells to Andrew who was going to drive back to Canberra, then headed out to give those relatives another try. Ended up finding Mel’s cousin and driving to Walcha to catch up with more family. Drove to Nimbin in the afternoon.\n\n**Day 16 (Nimbin – Armidale) Monday 15/12**\n\nMet Iain and Steve in Nimbin, where we had some lunch, some games of pool and then headed back to Armidale.\n\n**Day 17 (Armidale - Abercrombie) Tuesday 16/12**\n\nAfter a late breakfast at a Bakery in Armidale, headed towards home, stopping for lunch at Tamworth, and dinner at a really cool Irish pub in Mudgee (the interior design was really nice, as was the food!!). Drove all the way to the Abercrombie caves camping area.\n \n**Day 18 (Abercrombie - Canberra) Wednesday 17/12**\n\nGot up early in the morning in order to avoid paying camping fees. Checked out the Abercrombie walk through to the Stable Arch, then headed home with a last lunch at the Paragon in Goulburn (in keeping with NUCC tradition)."

So we trooped off to Wee J for a poke around in Punchbowl Cave. Many bats were found, no interesting mud sculptures were observed, and Chris could not be enticed to carry a cavepack full of kit to Loxin Wall for mostly no reason (as neither Britt nor Lachie turned out that keen to climb it anyway). wHowever Chris' shiny new Scurion did turn out to be useful, as we could see formation on the roof that none of us ever knew even existed...\n\nWe failed to find any new cave, as anywhere we went previous generations of NUCC or CSS would have been there anyway. However, we did find one speculative point that needs the scaling poles lurking in the store-room deployed against it. Saved for another time... "

    "body": "We left Canberra at the usual time of 8am plus some stuffing around, and made quick time to Wee Jasper. Once there, we were all keen to get underground, and barrelled off to the pitch into Series 4 of Dip Cave. Chris senior amazed us all by finding us the most absolutest safest looking rigging krab that any of us had ever seen. Sadly, Chris junior chose to scratch up the club's nice shiny new krabs in his rigging than use the rusty piece of muddy steel his Dad found. \n\n\nUnderground, we thoroughly explored Series 4 and 5 of Dip Cave (once the intrepid navigators found Series 5). Lachie succeeded in getting into Dismal Chamber this time, only to find that there was a walk-through passage that would have avoided a nasty squeeze, sketchy climb and several bruises. The Rathole was its usual delightful self, and abseiling double rope on old, wet, muddy 10.5mm rope was, well, interesting. We trooped out the Rubbish Tip entrance (after saying hi to Elvis), and decided that a late lunch and nap in the sun was preferable going caving again. NUCC runs real rough trips, we swear. "

    "body": "As our first trip for the year after the annual influx of beginners on Market Day, there were scores of new cavers spread between six cars heading up to Bungonia on Saturday morning. For many, this was going to be their first time underground so there was plenty of excitement.\n\nWe arrived around 10am and had enough people to split into three groups, giving more confident beginners a chance to explore more challenging obstacles while those less comfortable with heights could be given extra\nguidance. Bill disappeared to rig an exit to the day’s cave while others were shown around some of the nearby Bungonian wonders such as the cave Canberra-Steam Pipe (B7-14).\n\nAll three groups entered B4-5 (Fossil Cave- Hogans Hole) through the B5 entrance. The faster groups went first, while the rest were shown techniques for navigating squeezes and climbs using the holds available in the first few meters of the cave. All beginners were keen to challenge themselves, so all successfully attempted these obstacles, making for an efficient start to the day. Sending fresh beginners through a cave as sporty as B4-5 is designed to give them a quickstart introduction to the caving skills they will need later on, as well as appropriate exposure to small spaces, big drops and dusty clothing. So it was convenient that the beginners had such a positive attitude, allowing us time to fit more of the cave into the day.\n\nEach group took a slightly different route through the cave. The faster groups explored around the entrance of the B4-5 Extension, Kings Cross and checked out the tree roots in Root 19. Much complaint was heard when both faster groups collided in the very squeezy passageway below Root 19, with some excellent acrobatics being required to fit a dozen people into a chamber that would otherwise fit half that number.\n\nThe groups rendezvoused in Signature Chamber near the end of the cave to sit down and have some sugary snacks, as there was more climbing ahead of us. Here Bill found what appeared to be a large worm, and after preliminary inspection we deduced that we had found a small snake! Brittany endeavoured to save a life and very carefully extract the serpent from the cave via a small metal bottle to release it near the entrance, based on the assumption it was not a cave dweller. After some research into what we had discovered, she was confident it was a blackish blind snake *(Anilios nigrescens)*, which usually lives underneath leaf litter and travels through tunnels created by insects.\n\nAfter exiting the cave, Bill turned the contents of his small fridge into a food fountain large enough to feed 5000, offering an abundance of cakes, rolls and cinnamon buns to everyone who had the space to fit it in. \n\nHaving feasted, most of the crowd went on a small walk to check out the Lookdown over the beautiful Bungonia Gorge and slightly out of place limestone quarry. Following this, the many weary but newly christened cavers packed themselves back into cars, and we returned to the ANU car park where gear was returned and parting goodbyes made."

    "body": "[Jenolan](/locations/jenolan) has long been one of NUCC’s favourite caving locations, as it has a wonderful range of varied caves with plenty to see in them. Plus, it has the added bonus of a caver’s cottage with all sorts of useful bits and pieces, like a microwave for the two-minute noodles. Sadly, for many years we’d been unable to visit Jenolan due to a lack of members familiar enough with the caves. So after successfully becoming re-acquainted with Jenolan over 2018, we were all keen to have a trip there for our new 2019 members, and 13 of us all piled into cars for the trip up there. We got to the fantastic cottage at 9pm-ish, a cottage that is only sullied by the fact that someone unknown to NUCC has removed the old NUCC poster from the loungeroom. Plans are afoot to replace it…[^1] Most everyone got to bed at a reasonable time, except for a certain idiot Trip Leader and foolish canyoner, who stayed up to 1:30am talking about how it would be awesome for NUCC to go canyoning sometime.\n\nSaturday dawned overcast but not rainy- perfect weather for caving! After many cups of tea, the more recalcitrant cavers were brought into line, and we split into two groups for the day’s caving. This was at the late hour of 10am, which rather astounded the SUSS[^2] cavers who turned up later in the day to cart dive tanks into Slug Lake. Rather than the expected sleepy uni students, they found a deserted cottage. One group made a beeline to Aladdin Cave, and the other wandered off towards Mammoth Cave. This was slightly complicated by the fact that the guides had only given us one key, and both caves required it to open them. Chris was kindly volunteered by Lachie to shuttle the key between the caves and be bait for the cloud of leeches around the entrance to Mammoth. \n\nIn Mammoth, the group forged onwards, and into Railway Tunnel. Here, the morning’s caffeinated start made its sudden revenge, and one member of the intrepid party had to return to the surface for a short break. We wanted to visit Ice Pick Lake via Snakes Gut, but thought better of going through Unsurveyed Connection as there was a fair bit of loose rock around. Instead of going down Hole in the Wall, we took the path of least resistance, and rocketed down Railway Tunnel and around to Hell Hole. And so it was through (or past for the more intelligent members of the party) Hell Hole,, and the group enjoyed stomping along the passageway past the World of Mud to Ice Pick Lake. Here lunch was had, and unfortunate bananas laughed at, before a leisurely exit from Mammoth (well, leisurely for everyone except those poor cavers who needed to pee) and trek up to the cottage. Alas, no one could be persuaded to swim in Ice Pick Lake.\n\nThe Aladdin group apparently had a good time, and also visited Rho Hole. Seeing as they all successfully returned to the cottage, it appears that no-one amongst them was talked into entering the Kennedy Trap. Having been thoroughly traumatised by the abundance of pretty stuff in Aladdin, they all retired to the tourist precinct, thoughtfully not telling the other group where they were going. Still once they returned a relaxed evening got underway, with some disappointed SUSS divers trickling in (Lower River, and thus Slug Lake, was cloudy, which meant no diving). Despite NUCC’s usual poor culinary capabilities, no one managed to ruin their dinner this evening, and some people actually prepared real food, rather than the standard 2-minute noodles.\n\nSunday was a nice relaxed day of caving- the dispirited SUSSlings couldn’t even bring themselves to go caving, and the two NUCC groups went to Hennings Cave and Lower River in Mammoth Cave. The Hennings group had been planning to visit Wiburds Cave further up the valley, but gave up part way under heavy onslaught of leeches. Golden Grove was visited, but it was quite sad to see that there appears to have been some damage to the formation there. The Mammothers turned out to be less cowards than the group at Ice Pick Lake the day before, and apparently some members of the party went for a (voluntary) swim. Brrrrr…\n\nThe trip home from Canberra was good, with everyone stopping at a bakery in Goulburn for coffee and pies. Most of the party seemed to have enjoyed their stay in Jenolan, and hopefully everyone is looking forward to the next NUCC trip there on the 22/23rd June[^3].  Maybe we can introduce them all to some of the more special delights of Jenolan then, like Mammoth Squeeze or Pirates Delight…\n\n[^1]: A new one was finally put up in July during the SUSS week-long trip\n[^2]: Sydney Uni Sleeping Society,* as every caver in New South Wales well knows\n[^3]: Spoiler alert: three people went"

    "body": "Having been on too many SUSS trips, Lachie came up with the bright idea that it was time for NUCC to begin surveying again, after the club took an extended break from it all in the early 1990s. Of course, his survey experience was next to non-existent. So, the field was set for a ‘practise’ surveying trip to Mount Fairy, using the somewhat derelict surveying gear unearthed in the Great Storeroom Audit of 2019. Only four soon-to-be surveyors could be lured back out caving the day after a Punchbowl trip, which meant that (much to Chris’ dismay) everyone ended up in Lachie’s car for the trip out past Bungendore.\n\nTrooping up over the hill to Mount Fairy, we dumped all our gear in the entrance chamber of Main Cave (MF1-4), and studied the chambers measureless to all but NUCC. At which point it quickly became obvious- Lachie had chosen a rather complex cave for a first go at surveying... Still, not to be dissuaded, we launched into the survey. Chris and Whitley handled the tape, Lachie sketched, and Andy was the instrumentalist (shame about the lack of church bells, hey).\n\nImmediately, deep existential questions of the sort NUCC is unaccustomed arose- like, are the LRUDs taken perpendicular to the station or the leg; are we sketching with the true distances or the hypotenusenal distances; and can we use Chris’ Scurion as a permanent survey station? After about six legs in two hours (half of that spent arguing), Lachie spat the dummy and stormed out of the cave to have lunch.\n\nOn the surface, the sun worked its wonderful calming powers, and everyone agreed to cease surveying for the day before knives were drawn. A tourist trip through the cave was\nquickly planned, and just as quickly aborted due to presence of bats. So we did what NUCC does best- napped in the sun for a while and talked about how we could be going caving right now.\n\nAfter a while, Lachie and Andy wandered off to look for MF25, which has some pretties in it, while Chris meandered up the valley. Whitley snooped around in the gorge, and found a couple of interesting holes. Lachie and Chris came back to see what was up, and Chris and Whitley vanished into the holes, while Lachie took one look at the briar bushes guarding them and had a doze in the creekbed.\n\nAfter a while Chris came back and reported that there was a squeeze, and Lachie should try it. He did, and got 2/3 of the way through before chickening out (apparently, he’s just too damn tall). So Whitley had a go at it, and after removing her helmet, broke through into suspiciously un-trogged cave. A lighter and a camera (but not a Chris or Andy, as neither fitted) were hurriedly passed through the squeeze, and Whitley headed off to explore, with Chris jammed in the squeeze as a communications relay. Lachie and Andy tried to dig an alternative route past the squeeze, but it proved too much for bare hands. After Whitley returned with video of the far section (including some bizarre commentary on worms), we all trooped back to the car in the last of the sunlight, elated that NUCC had found what looked to be a new cave!"

    "body": "There is currently a statement on the NUCC website under the page on Mount Fairy: “We always go to Mount Fairy as a day trip”, so of course Lachie set out to prove the author wrong.1 The main reason for the trip was that in the space of a week, the status of NUCC’s new cave had become hotly contested, as there was a HSC cave within the margin of error of the GPS used that had a kinda similar map. And plus, we found one cave at Mount Fairy, who knows what else there is to find? I still haven’t located the fire-breathing wombats that are supposed to be endemic to the area; they must be yet another casualty of the NSW government’s environmental policies. So Chris, Andy and Lachie trooped back, once again (with more dismay from Chris) in Lachie’s X-Trail. Apparently he took the corner off the Tarago road less like a madman this time though, so the club’s driving standards might be improving.\n\nWe quickly set up camp, and headed off to say hi to the local landowners. They were really friendly, and we were allowed access to the old quarry area, and to the area around the Effluxes for Main Cave. However, first priority was our new cave, so after a quick squiz at the quarry (some interesting mining relics and lots of blackberries) we headed off across the Zimmerman’s property towards Main Cave and set to work looking for MF59.\n\nFour hours later, we finally found it, buried under a massive thicket of blackberries that Andy had hacked through (getting him appointed as the club horticulturalist). This confirms that our cave from the previous weekend was most likely new! With much effort, Lachie, Chris and Andy all made it through the squeeze in the new cave too, and in that order of increasing difficulty as well... We estimated there’s about 40m of passageway in the cave, much of it tall enough to stand up in, with some obvious abandoned streamway. A few leads were pushed, one requiring traffic control to delicately pass some straws. A couple of maybe leads remain, along with an obvious dig that would be awful.\n\nWe also attempted a voice connection to the MF35 mine adit, with no results except that Lachie was nearly deafened by blowing on his whistle in an enclosed space. Lachie eventually got bored and tapeseiled into MF25, discovering that it is a brilliant piece of cave that *really* needs another visit and a ladder to get back out.\n\nOn finishing the day’s caving, a short walk up the valley was had to see the extent of the limestone and spot some of the other\nentrances. We got back just on sunset, and were very kindly allowed by one of the landholders to collect some firewood, so the chilly evening was greatly brightened by a campfire.\n\nDay 2 did not feature another visit to the Main Cave area- we wandered around to the Effluxes on Sandhills Creek, and Lachie found another new cave on the hill above them. Sadly, it was smaller than Whitley’s at only 6m or so long, and he encountered an unimpressed wombat on the wrong side of a nasty bedrock squeeze. Wedgies were seen, blackberry bushes were contemplated, and surfaces were trogged.\n\nEventually we crossed over Sandhills Creek and had a look at the limestone on the north side of the creek, although we didn’t find anything cavey. A mid-afternoon retreat was made back to Canberra, leaving much unfinished business at Mount Fairy. NUCC will be back..."

    "body": "The April 2019 Easter Cooleman- Yarrangobilly trip, originally planned as a double between Cooleman and Yagby, was rescheduled to a four day Cooleman due to numbers. Initially, four NUCC members headed up on Friday to set themselves up for an early start the next day. Upon arriving at blue waterholes campground, we were shocked to find such a packed campsite. All of the campgrounds were packed, but luckily we were able to recognise some SUSS vehicles, and set up near their gazebos.\n\nWithin an hour of arriving and setting up we were approached by a wild ROC team emerging from the wilderness after exploring Frustration Cave (CP10). Slowly but surely members from SUSS, ROC, MUMC and MSS arrived one by one from various directions until a bustling group of 20 or so campers were sitting around a large campfire, fuelled by planks brought by individuals.\n\nOn Friday NUCC and ROC travelled into CP92 and CP93 to explore for recreational caving. CP92 was extremely muddy which didn’t help our attempts to navigate the extremely tiny holes that had been dug out within the phreatic tubes. Alan Pryke is to blame for the minimalist dig! CP93 on the other hand was marvellous (Note: either Andy has mixed his caves here, or his version of marvellous is waay off).\n\nOn Saturday NUCC initiated a survey attempt of Black Range Cave (CP12). As it turned out, the Disto had not been calibrated correctly and required a second, more professional attempt at mapping it on Sunday. This was done with much help from Phil Maynard and Ian Cooper from SUSS. On the way to Black Range, we did a quick pass through Barbers Cave (CP14) from the lowest of the two entrances. Once inside, we stumbled across a group of about 10 mates from Wagga in their twenties struggling to get down the climb connecting the two entrances. They had less than adequate caving gear so we helped them down the climb. They said, “Follow the people with the helmets!”, and used our guidance to exit further up the hill. Our help was greatly appreciated, so we were rewarded with beers as we passed by their campsite on our return. At dinner time, there were all sorts of fancy dishes to learn from people; particularly Alan Green from MSS, who slapped a giant slab of lamb on the hot plate (a clear winner).\n\nOn Saturday night two more NUCCers arrived to stay the night, and on Sunday we split up in all directions. One group went to Easter Cave (CP21) and only looked through the entrance as we had not received a permit for this cave. I stayed back at the campsite to study and was approached by a couple of rangers throughout the day inquiring about the conditions of the site, as well as a man conducting a survey for the Snowy 2.0 Feasibility Study, which he had apparently been doing for about 2 years.\n\nIn the afternoon we ventured into Frustration Valley to find Frustration Cave, which we were not successful in doing because we had walked up the wrong hill. We did however find CP52, where we came across a large spider. After lots of surface trogging we eventually found Clown Cave (CP11) on return, and could only spend half an hour or so in the valley poking our heads in holes.\n\nMonday was spent in Cooleman Main (CP1) and Murrays Cave (CP3), discovering the maps were quite out of date. Some people also went on a drive to Tantangara Reservoir for sightseeing (Lachie got a flat tyre). Overall the trip was a thriller to have so many speleos in one spot at one time."

    "body": "On Saturday morning, a group of intrepid cavers left ANU bright and early to go and explore Wyanbene Cave. Dressed to survive the wet and cold conditions of a streamway cave, we entered the dark and got down to business (eventually, after much deliberation about how many ladders were needed – for the record, 1 x 50ft was fine).\n\nThe water level was relatively low, so we stayed dry-ish for the first part after entering the cave. That changed pretty quickly as the water level overflowed gumboots or people abandoned staying dry in favour of easier crawling. Even when the water is low, a streamway cave is still a streamway cave!\n\nBy the time we got to the gate, everyone was having a great time. After the handline was set up and the gate unlocked (a difficult process),\npeople examined the sump and had a chat about the cave. We all agreed that it was pretty great – and we weren’t even at the ‘good‘ section yet! Past the gate we explored a small chamber on the other side of a squeeze between the gate and ladder pitch. It had a teasing amount of helictites inside, and got us excited for what was to come.\n\nHelictite Chamber did not disappoint either! There was an amazing amount of formation around us, clumps of helictites larger than anything any of us had seen before, alongside some lovely shawls and a few stalactites. Eventually, though, we continued on towards our final destination, Gunbarrel Aven.\n\nI honestly didn’t think anything would impress us more than the helictites, but I was wrong. As you walk into the aven, you’re just immediately hit with a sense of BIG walls. The 100m+ of sheer rock curving up into the dark (even Scurions could barely light up the top!) and surrounding you in a circular ‘gunbarrel’- esque shape was magnificent. The climbers among us were instantly plotting where possible routes could be set, and all of us were just looked around taking it in. We ended up all sitting down and just staring up, trying to decide if the long shape on one of the side walls was a balloon being overgrown by calcite and mud or just a very strange formation, and admiring the huge chockstone that separates the Gunbarrel from another adjacent aven.\n\nAfter a while, though, the fact that we had spent the last few hours wet caught up to us, and it was time to head out again. I was immensely happy that I had thought to wear knee-pads as we entered the streamway crawl. For once, my knees escaped a trip unbruised!\n\nWe reached the ladder pitch much faster on the way out that the way in, and it was this time, with nothing to lose by getting even more drenched, that a few of us had a look at the duck under in the streamway. Sitting in chest deep water trying to find a hole that you can’t see is definitely an activity for on the way out of the cave – its not a warm experience. All we have to say about that duck under option is “NO WAY”. Its deep and boggy, the gap in the rock is narrow sideways, and it would need digging out before it would be safe to attempt, as there’s only about 20cm clearance.\n\nBeing soaked while waiting in-between the ladder and hand-line, I was glad that my thermals were pretty effective! Even wearing them, I got a really good feeling of why this section was called the ‘Blowhole’, and I was glad I didn’t have to wait there too long!\n\nIt was nearly dark by the time we were out of the cave, and we were all a little weary, but everyone agreed that it had been a great day. There were a few of us who wished we had thought to bring a towel, but we changed into car clothes nevertheless, and by the time we got back to ANU we were nearly warm again!\n\nWyanbene- would do again!"

We literally got access permission the night before, so there had been some talk of SRT at Bungonia instead. The three main goals were to:\n\nA.) GPS locate as many of the caves in and around the main creekline as we could\n\nB.) Take photos and measurements of all the sumps in Main Cave (MF1-4) to provide bait to entice SUSS divers down here\n\nC.) Relax in the sun\n\nWe had some progress on goals A and B. Goal C was the only unmitigated success.\n\nIt was extremely windy at the carpark for Mount Fairy, so windy that we were dreading that the valley would be some sort of wind- tube. Everyone geared up accordingly, especially Lachie, who geared up so thoroughly for freezing winds that he needed help to stuff his gumboots on over a billion pairs of socks. We were instead very surprised to find it very pleasant and wind-free in the valley, and immediately set about looking for lost caves and GPSing the ones we knew. This took some time, slowed by the blackberries and some dork loosing our only copy of the Mount Fairy book down a shaft, requiring the setup of a ladder and belay to retrieve it. Andy was on form as the NUCC horticulturalist, and Whitley found yet more horrible little crawly holes that may go somewhere.\n\nChris and Lachie made a foray into Main Cave to try and reach Sump 1, but had to retreat from every attempted route due to the hibernating bats. However the small sump on the way to the Cat Door (MF50) was reachable, and was quite low and full of yabbies. Neither Chris nor Lachie could entice the other to try the sniffer it presented.\n\nThe Cat Door proved easy enough to reach from inside Main Cave, but alas, opens up into blackberry soup. Lachie tried to convince Chris to crawl through a dead wombat into this blackberry mess as a supposed easy route out of the cave, but something about the inordinate amount of glee in Lachie’s voice dissuaded him from attempting it.\n\nEventually the breeze came back, and we beat a very brave retreat back to Canberra after a successful day- we located over two-thirds of the known caves at Mount Fairy. Unfortunately, several new things were also added to the large Mount Fairy to-do list..."

We collected gear from the store room, split into three cars and left for Wee Jasper. It was extremely foggy, so we couldn't see any of the surface geology that Wee Jasper is known for. We decided to split into two groups with one group laddering into Gong Chamber (the Series 4 Extension in Dip Cave) and the other group exploring Series 1 and 2 via the Rubbish Tip entrance (Ed note: Gong Chamber of Dip Cave is connected to Series 4 by an impenetrable slot, but some call it Gong Cave regardless).  \n\nMy group started with Gong Chamber. I prepared poorly for this cave by wearing Cordura overalls which left me sweating profusely after a few minutes of caving. Thus, I removed the overalls and spent the rest of the cave in shorts and a T-shirt which was far more comfortably but left me feeling a little unprotected (some knee pads would have been appreciated). I definitely believe cotton overalls are the way to go for dry caving, especially at Bungonia and Wee Jasper. After laddering out, we attempted to locate the tag but with no luck. Either it has been cleverly placed far from any obvious location, or covered with vegetation as often happens to cave tags.\n\nWe had lunch and then swapped caves with my group entering Series 1 and 2. The Rubbish Tip entrance seems fairly well maintained with a newish looking rope in place to prevent any slipping and crawling in glass. While my group was exploring Series 1 and 2, apparently the other group was having fun attempting to get each other stuck near Gong Chamber. They discovered a squeeze that takes them into the same chamber, i.e. utterly pointless (the best kind of squeeze) which you had to be in just the right position to get through. I am keen to give this squeeze a go on a future trip. Inside Series 2 I had a little play with photography, but got a little stumped by the focus. Lesson here is to get things working above ground before going underground.\n\nAt around 2pm we exited back out the Rubbish Tip to find the other group had finished Gong and been waiting around for 'years'. Since there was still plenty of daylight we migrated over to Signature Cave. On the way we had a little crawl through Amoeba Cave (not sure if that's its actual name) or at least some of us did (Note: this is a long running discussion, and I am pleased to report that what we’ve been calling Amoeba is actually Anemone Cave). It's funny how the most experienced cavers seem the least willing to do crawls, but the most excited to get others crawling. We had a fairly relaxed stroll through Signature Cave and I got a couple more photos, but with my phone this time. Afterwards four of us went up the hill to locate the tag on Devil's Punchbowl. I was nominated to go search for the tag. After five minutes of finding nothing Lachlan came in to help and found it instantly, up at the top of doline. Devil's Punchbowl is a very impressive karst feature that I highly recommend visiting if you're in the area. The fog had cleared for the drive home so we could actually see the Wee Jasper hillsides. We arrived back at ANU just as the sun was setting, marking the end of a successful and enjoyable trip."

    "body": "It was time for our Semester 2 Bungonia Beginner’s trip. We had a fantastic day’s caving planned- B4-5, Grill and Hollands Hole, all a great introduction to sport caving. As normal, we piled into cars, this time fitting all 11 cavers into two cars (six in one, and five in the other) for the short drive out to Bungonia. Everything went swimmingly, and by the time we passed through Bungonia township, we were all looking forward to getting out of the cars and getting underground.\n\nUnfortunately, at the park we were greeted by a closed gate and a big, pink sign, with large, block letters of DOOM in black on it: PARK CLOSED. A smaller, more official NPWS sign declared that the park was closed for feral animal culling (probably aimed at pigs and goats). Oops.\n\nWe briefly considered sneaking into the park, but this idea died very quickly, because a), it was completely illegal, and b), we could hear a steady stream of gunshots issuing out of the park.\n\nSanity prevailed, and we considered what to do. A bushwalk? Most of us weren’t properly equipped for the sort of bushwalking Bungonia offers. A canyon? They’re all closed too, and besides, it’s meant to be a beginner’s trip. Mount Fairy? Nope, it’s on private property, and is batty at this time of year. Wombeyan? Good luck getting access to anything more exciting than Tinted Cave. Wee Jasper? We were there last weekend and did most of the horizontal options then. Bungonia on private property? Lachie doesn’t know who to ask for access, and didn’t bring his copy of Under Bungonia anyway. Go home to Canberra in disgrace? No, us NUCCers (even NUCCers on their first trip) are made of sterner stuff than that!\n\nWe ended up with two options: Wyanbene, or bouldering at Tianjara. We opted for the former, as limestone was involved, as opposed to the nasty sandstone stuff that climbers seem so fond of. Unfortunately, Wyanbene is a 1.5h drive south of Bungonia, so it wasn’t until just after midday that we got there (we stopped at Braidwood for fuel and a break).\n\nLunches were quickly scoffed in the carpark as everyone dived into their caving kit, keen to (finally) get underground. Some of the beginners paused after looking at the first wet crawl, but they all leapt at the chance to get wet. Some even managed to stay a bit dry. We all enjoyed stomping down the streamway to look at Sump 1, and one cruel experienced member may have got some joy by indicating that it was the way on.\n\nFortunately, it isn’t, and we headed up into the old tourist chamber. After exploring that thoroughly and doing a spot of photography, we climbed up to Bat Chamber to look at the tree roots. It was unusually-un batty, with the sketchy climb only having a light dusting of guano. After the tree roots received appropriate admiration, we turned round and gradually made our way out of the cave.\n\nMuch joy was experienced by all when one gumbooted individual (who had otherwise managed to maintain dry feet) had an encounter with water levels in excess of CWD. We also examined The Elephant on the way out, and came to the conclusion that it is erroneously named: it should be The Mammoth instead (no relation to either the Hairy Diprotodon or Woolly Rhinoceros that continue to haunt cavers at Jenolan). This should be regarded as a contribution to the speleological knowledge of Wyanbene Main Cave of paramount importance.\n\nOn the surface, there was much rejoicing about dry clothes after 2h spent underground. As it was too late for a walk up to the Big Hole, we decamped back to Canberra via Captains Flat. Consideration was had of a visit to the pub there; half the group thought it was a fantastic idea, the other half just wanted to go home. End result: NUCC stayed sober- this time."

Whitley and I were trying out our new trogsuits for the New Zealand trip happening in a fortnight, and they did a good job of stopping the snow and blackberries. The entrance to East Deep Creek was nearly buried in snow, and it was cool to see icicles in the shape of shawls and stalactites around the entrance of the cave. Inside the cave, we went down to an amazing room of formation that we had to detrog for, and Lachie spent ages mucking around with his camera while we all froze in our detrog gear.\n\nComing out, we went over the hill to visit Restoration Cave, but Whitley, Bill and Emma decided it was getting late and headed back to the cars. Chris, Lachie and I got in as far as the old gate spot, but realised we had the key for the cottage, so headed off after the others. So, no Restoration, but we got a good evening around the campfire instead.\n\nOn Sunday, Chris, Emma and Bill went down to Coppermine and enjoyed the front section and\nsump. Lachie, Whitley and I went looking for Bathhouse instead, but chose the wrong gully and spent the day bushbashing instead. We decided to follow the creek anyway, and see where it sank, but there were no caves sadly (we had the misfortune to pick Traverse Creek, which traverses the limestone, but doesn’t have a known sink). Still we did find a nice waterfall instead, on the creek where it headed down into the gorge before heading home."

Much amazement ensured, seeing as I’ve been 5 minutes late for the last 4 caving trips. Despite my worries, we managed to get everything packed in, once I removed a 30m 11mm rope from the rope bag and bestowed it upon Chris Snr. We even managed to get the early bus from Jolimont, leaving at 12:30pm rather than 1pm. \n\n\nThe bus trip was pretty uneventful, and we were early enough that the check-in for our flight wasn’t even open yet. Security was painful though- apparently my hair is very suspicious, as the X-ray scanner highlighted it, and I got swabbed for drugs and explosives. Maybe they were bored? Or maybe they heard me pontificating about duty-free being a palace to consumerism and decided to frisk the commie. We killed time at the airport (sleeping), and eventually got onto the plane. Luckily there was still an empty seat where Britt should have been (still sad she couldn’t come though), and Lachy and I got upgraded to extra leg-room in the first row. No one got any sleep, so it was still a long 3h flight… \n\n***1-9-19 (Sunday): The Pilgrimage North***\n\n**Lachie:** We arrived in Christchurch about 12:45am, and Lachy and I were second off the plane, and first through the obligatory duty-free area. They pounced on us like hawks, even though we didn’t want anything. We also got a bit of a hard time in customs- they didn’t give a toss about our caving kit, but pulled out our tents and inspected every bit of them. \n\nAfter escaping the airport (Chris ran into someone he knew from school called Becky), we picked up the cars, which were rather nicer than expected. Lachy was jealous that the Corolla that I ended up with (we booked a Tiida) had Bluetooth. Still had plenty of scratches though, so we took photos of the lot. They also tried to play hardball because no Britt for the car in her name, but luckily a rather aggressive ‘I explicitly asked Apex about this, and they said it was fine!’ caused them to back down. The Corolla was very different from driving my X-Trail- the suspension actually suspends, the cruise control was confusing, and nothing was where it was meant to be. \n\nOnce the cars were picked up, we went searching for a Maccas for dinner- but the first one Andy took us to was closed. The second was open though, so we still got a feed. On leaving, I evidently didn’t put my lights on, and didn’t notice because we were in a built-up area with overhead lights (and the headlights were extremely dim anyway). I found out quickly though, because I got pulled over by the cops. Good job Lachie: been in the country for two hours and you’ve already been pulled over. Luckily, I escaped with a warning, and I very nervously proceeded north out of Christchurch. Andy slept, I listened to Magnus Archives, and we saw none of the scenery hidden in the inky blackness. \n\nEventually we made it to the Boyle River Campground that we were aiming for, and we all slept in the cars. Well, except for me, I slept next to my car using my tent as a bivvy. We nearly gave up before Boyle River to sleep at a roadside pullover, but moved on once we realised that a), we were only 6km short of Boyle River, and b), there was a dead sheep festering in the bushes in the middle of it all. I went to sleep immediately, and then woke up right away as my un-disabled alarm from 5:30am yesterday went off. GAAAH. \n\n\n**Andy:** The rest of us slept in the cars, but it really wasn’t the worst place on the planet to wake up. Just looking through the windscreen I could see the mountains towering over us and white capped peaks staring back. It was now we realised we’d been driving through a valley and the height of the mountains came as a shock at first. Soon after waking we were on the road again. We drove past magnificent scenery as a backdrop to farms, forests and plains, and everything was very green. \n\nAfter around an hour or two of driving we arrived at a trig-point and lookout off the road where we admired the many white mountains completely surrounding us far in the distance. It was here that we all realised we were hungry, so decided to grab a bite to eat at the next town. Arriving at Wakefield we went to the bakery and split up because the line was so long. Lachie and I headed off to Richmond while the others waited in line. They were much hungrier than we were! \n\nArriving in Richmond Lachie I went straight to Greg Pickford’s house to pick up the key, which was stowed in the letter box as he was out. Minutes later he arrived on bike and we got to have a chat with him. Lachy and Chris turned up with the steak and stout pies, which were just what we needed! We ate on the kerb before then heading in to town. In town, we went to Bunnings to grab some gumboots (which are softer than those bought in Australia and not so desirable) and batteries. Next stop was Countdown to grab the food, where Lachie and I made calls to our Dads for Father’s Day (in the carpark). \n\nWe spent a long time in the shops but made good decisions, lining up some Thai Green Chicken Curry and Vego Lentil/beans for the next couple of nights. Next stop was the booze. The local beer turned out to be very tasty indeed. (**Lachie:** Tui, which turned out to be not so local, and anathema to South Islanders) \n\nThen it was time to head up the mountain. At about this point I discovered how to work the Bluetooth on our vehicle with much delight. (**Lachie:** well, this is somewhat subjective) Coldplay Parachutes was our ambience as we climbed Takaka Hill. The road had been washed out in a number of spots and cars travelled in a single lane governed by a red light where we waited for about 5 minutes. The views were killer with snowy capped mountains in the same portrait as the ocean. \n\nThe road into the cottage wasn’t as bad as I had thought it would be (the bad bits were done up six months ago). The cottage itself impressed all of us though, with its spacious main room, fire, abundance of firewood, and good quality dunnies. What was most exciting were the caves we stumbled across and peeked down barely within 10m of the hut. Most of the drops looked about 10-15 metres. One cave on the walk to the dunny was covered in a grill in case people fall down 15m on their way to the loo… Oops! After a small peak around it was time to crack open the beer, and start cooking dinner (**Lachie:** Thai Green Chicken Curry, or should that be Thai Green Curry Chicken). \n\nLachie and I headed down the hill a bit west to make a phone call to Chris Whiting from NSG for some advice on the local caves. While he was doing that, I took some pictures of the sun setting over the mountains at Harwood Lookout, which was nearby. We very much enjoyed the extra strong tea Lachie had gotten and made many cups of it (Chanui Extra Strong, comes with a tea-addict’s stamp of approval). \n\nA little into the night a head-torch wandered near the hut. We went out to have a look and met Bruce, a local from Nelson, and someone who had helped build the impressive hut. He stayed the night and left first thing in the morning. Overall the day was pretty exciting: getting used to our new home for the next couple of weeks, and enjoying a much needed good night’s sleep on large mattresses in a warm room. \n\n***2-9-19 (Monday): Summit Tomo***\n\n**Chris:** Woke up at a lovely 10am. Drove for ages (5 minutes) to car park. Walked up firetrail, turned right at walking trail, turned left into scrub about 5 metres after intersection. Went down doline, found cave (**Lachie:** thanks to Chris Whiting’s instructions, my grid reference that I got from an old NZSS Bulletin put the cave nearly 400m away). Little crawl into cave to begin, then 10m in slightly squeezy tape climb. 10m further dodgy unassisted climb around and down a rock pile. Got halfway through the climb before becoming petrified of the heights (was only mildly terrified beforehand). Andy tried talking me down, and explaining where to put hands/feet… didn’t help. After about 5 minutes, Deakin came back to help. He came to where I was and redid the climb, and then I just copied that. That seemed to work. Walked/slid down 10m steep mud bank. Saw glow worms in Ruamokos Hall. Walked down Ruamokos Hall over heaps of loose rocks. Got down to handline, watched Lachlan and Andy do it easily, then attempted it but didn’t like it at all so gave up and exited cave. \n\nDeakin came back up to the climb I hated to make sure I was ok, I got it done a little faster this time, but not much. I banged my knee on the tape climb on the way out. That hurt. After exiting I had a chat to a nice old lady who found it a bit strange to see someone walking around in overalls with a helmet on. Apparently she has a daughter who works with Nelson national parks finding caves. I went down to the car to put SRT kit away, then returned to the cave to drop the car keys off. \n\nI then decided to walk up the nearest hill to see the view. It took about 5 minutes before I got too hot for my overalls, so carried them for the rest of the day. I was following a track, unaware of where it went, but figured I would follow it until I either reached the end or had been walking for 3 hours and needed to return to the hut for our agreed emergency time of 8pm. The track came to T-intersection and I turned right to continue upwards. When I reached the top there were about 5 towers and a quaint little house on a nearby hill. You could see the ocean, along with multiple mountain ranges with snow topped peaks. I’m guessing I could see Mt Arthur, but I wasn’t sure which one it was. \n\nOddly the track continued down the other side of the peak, but thankfully there was a map that explained that I was on the Takaka Walkway loop. Based on the map, the loop looked around 5km, so I decided to continue round. It was mostly nice walking with a few rainforest sections and a few more nice views, although the track could do with some trimming. New Zealand has plenty of super spiky plants, I recommend long pants for that walk. \n\nThere were caves scattered along the walk with each one having its own little ‘Danger Tomo’ signpost. Once I finished the loop I walked down to check out the dead cow that was well preserved inside a broken down house. I also did the rainforest loop. The first half of the loop was nice, following a river inside a rainforest, and goes past the point where the river goes into a cave. The second half was more prickly stuff, don’t recommend.\n \nI then walked back to the hut, and explored the surrounding property. \n\n**Lachie:** After Chris left us, Andy and I went to the top of the first pitch in Summit Tomo, called Protector Pitch, and I started deploying the fixed rigging. Lachy got back just as I had finished, and we proceded down the pitch, which had a real shit first rebelay a few meters down. It was followed by a second rebelay shortly after (less nasty), and then became a nice free-hang into a big chamber. \n\nAt the bottom of this, I had a minor case of geographic embarrassment, but we quickly found the right way down to a pretty impressive streamway passage. This dropped down a series of rather fun waterfalls, and then vanished down a hole towards what I presume is Turehu Towers. We left the streamway here, and went up an 11m pitch, and then down another short pitch (yet more awkward rigging) and along a rather damp rift. This rift eventually matured into a waterfall and the final pitch. \n\nWe had lunch at the bottom of this and crusied on deeper into the cave. I chose the left branch- it would later transpire we should have gone right because left is nasty. We went a while, but had given Chris a call out time of 8pm. Well, it was a call out time for him, in case he’d broken a leg hopping over the karst and was bushed somewhere. But we hadn’t made it clear it was for him only and not for us too- and plus you can’t exactly call out a search party for someone while you’re underground! So we turned around after about 4h underground, and headed to the surface. I had a nasty time getting back- I lost a glove on the waterfall pitch just as I finished de-rigging, and as I couldn’t see it down below was disinclined to go get it, although I’ll come back later in the trip! I also started getting leg cramps on the pitch before we got to the 11m (now down) pitch, and needed Andy’s help to extricate myself from being suspended in mid air. The 40m pitch was also a bugger- I was now getting both arm and leg cramps, which is rather incapacitating while prusiking. They got so bad that after manoeuvring myself past the last rebelay on the way up, I couldn’t feel or move my thumbs- they were both cramped into place. Thankfully, Lachy and Andy helped with tidying up the fixed rigging, and we made a swift exit from the cave. There was frost settled on our car parked at Takaka Hill Walkway, and not surprisingly, we had the whole carpark to ourselves… \n\nSummit Tomo was a fantastic introduction to New Zealand caves, and if they’re all like this, it should be a great trip! We got back to the cottage at 7:30pm to find that Chris was safe and sound and had a fire set for us. A late but delicious dinner of lentils and veggies followed. The hut has a shower that is operated via a bucket with some hose attached to it, and we contemplated using it, but decided to instead get an early(ish) night before Middle Earth and the infamous Lighthouse Pitch tomorrow. \n\n***3-9-19 (Tuesday): Middle Earth***\n\n**Lachie:** A big day. A very big day. I will admit I had some somewhat nervous feelings about what we were committing too- my phone call to Chris W had resulted in him offering to take us on a round-trip through Middle Earth Cave. I was excited by this, as I really wanted to visit Middle Earth, and Chris W was taking us up the Lighthouse Pitch, which Alex Williams from ROC had recommended that we must absolutely do while we were at Takaka. But Chris W was very reassuring when we met him at the Harwoods Hole turnoff for the short drive to the cave, and was surprised by how far into Summit Tomo we had gotten the previous day. Apparently the ‘Boots Off’ section was the best way to go, not the nasty crawly way we chose and stopped at (oops, it looked better on the map). But apparently Boots Off is very nice, so between that and my missing glove, so I think there is unfinished business here... Maybe once Whitley arrives? Chris also reckons Turehu Towers is boring, but I still kind wanna. \n\nAnyway, we quickly dived into the cave (me wearing one Macpac glove and one Bunnings gardening glove), which is only a short distance from the main road, using our shiny 54m 9.5mm rope to rig the first pitch (fast!). From here, the cave was pretty full on: we clattered past the bottom of the Enviro Pitch, down into Smaugs Hall, down the Connection Pitch. This was just after a mucky crawl, so was a very slow rope, so slow that Chris B needed to use my rack to get down (and then I had to haul it back up). He also kicked a massive boulder loose on the way down, which thankfully missed Chris W and Andy at the bottom (it would have been deadly). \n\nContinued down through the Hall of Ships, past the Greenlink Connection, and had lunch shortly afterwards at the halfway point. After this it was up, up, up, down Cannonball Alley, UP, UP, up, up. This part of the cave is a massive, impressive chamber: Wyanbene’s Gunbarrel Aven on steroids. The Lighthouse Pitch failed to disappoint, even from below: a freehanging pitch in a vast chamber, 60m up to a distant ledge on the roof. Then followed a pendulum and a series of small rebelays, up maybe another 50m in bits. I kinda screwed up the pendulum, and pendulumed myself into the far wall: a wall of marble punching you in the face after about 10m of acceleration hurts! And even as I write this on Wednesday night, my nose still doesn’t quite feel the same… Thankfully, both Chrises, Andy and Lachy all failed to complete a similar trick, and we all got to the top safely, albeit slightly spooked by a small rub-point somewhere around 105m above the deck. \n\nChris W then led us out through the upper sections of Middle Earth to the Hobbit Hole, which had some really spectacular formation (although all of us were a bit too tired to appreciate it). We even had a peek at Pickford’s Parlour, which reminded me of the streamway in Eagle’s Nest at Yagby. Chris W had a different name for it though, based on what a French gentleman called Benoir had gotten up to in there *(Ed: I really hope I’m slandering the right person here)*. We made it out of the Hobbit Hole right on the dot of 7:30, which was a relief, as Chris W had specified a call out time of 8pm. Another fantastic cave, and thanks so much to Chris W for taking his time to help the Aussie tourists through it! We decided to leave our 54m rope in the cave and retrieve it later: we were all keen to be back at the cottage, and a trip back to the Enviro Pitch would be nice. Chris W accompanied us back to the hut for a beer, and gave us some recommendations of caves to visit, and we spent a good couple of hours chatting about caving in the area before he headed home. Dinner was a mashup of whatever we had, so onions, paprika, cumin and coriander cooked together as a sauce, along with the free gravy from Countdown at Stoke and rice. The gravy was a fantastic addition: maybe it was just because it was free (a previous customer left it behind, so they gave it to us), but it tasted yummy. We all slept very well tonight!\n\n***4-9-19 (Wednesday): Shopping Odyssey***\n\n**Lachie:** After Middle Earth yesterday we were all feeling a little bit tired, and decided on a rest day, under siege by the Hut’s resident weka. The fact that it was bucketing down rain and we were mostly out of food also helped convince us of our choice! So after a leisurely breakfast and morning, we all trooped off down the hill to Motueka for some house-keeping. Andy camped in Maccas for the free wifi, I went to Mitre 10 to procure new gloves (still want the missing one back though), and Chris and Lachy went to Countdownworths to get more food. We did a somewhat better job of planning out meals this time- hopefully we have 6 nights food, rather than the 3 we got in last time… \n\nWe regrouped in Maccas and spent a while there waiting for my computer to charge, before heading back up the hill to home. As with both previous trips, we got stuck at the lights. I swear that they’re perpetually stuck on 6-12 minutes! Like any good rest day, the rest of the arvo and evening was occupied by beer, tea, chatting, reading, and no attempt to go caving whatsoever, despite the three obvious entrances beckoning at us within a short walk of the cottage (Earl Grey, Cabbage Pot, and something small, nasty and likely nameless). I cooked chilli for dinner, which seemed to be a hit, despite the lack of chilli in it. \n\nMade plans for tomorrow too: I was keen to visit Eds Cellar, but Kieran warned us off it after the rain by text (hopefully he’ll be around tomorrow evening). So we’re going to go to Commentary Cave (Chris reckoned it should be fine), and check out Little Harwoods Cave if we can find it. Fingers crossed that my grid reference for it is a little bit more accurate than the one I had for Summit Tomo… \n\n***5-9-19 (Thursday):Takaka Valley***\n\n**Lachie:** Bearing in mind the warnings from Chris W and Kieran about the general wetness of everything, we headed down Takaka Hill to the west. Aim of the day: Commentary Cave, a cave that apparently never floods in any weather. The drive down the hill was slow, with a damp road and lots of very sharp turns. No rain, thankfully, and the forecast suggested that it should hopefully be a bit dry for the rest of the day. We found the relevant farmer’s field, and spotted the area with caves pretty easy- a large hill studded with dolines. \n\nHowever, getting ready to go caving was less than easy: as we had now abandoned the heights of Takaka Hill, the sandflies we out. In Force. They went for me first, descending in a cloud of doom, whilst just pestering Chris, Andy and Lachy. But the doom-cloud spread, first to Andy, and then to Chris and Lachy. Soon we were all racing across the farmer’s fields, hoping to outpace the cloud of sandflies behind us. \n\nAlso, we were all quite grateful of the fact that caving involves pretty much neck-foot clothing cover… Sandflies may be tough, persistent bastards, but even they can’t bite through cordura overalls! \n\nWe went through a huge gate, and up the hill to the pine plantation, past a small impenetrable resurgence (possibly the Commentary Cave resurgence). Then we followed the edge of the pine plantation till we came to a running stream, which plunged down a small pitch into a cave in a semi-circular streamsink. Bingo! \n\nWe figured this was the Tomo Entrance, and plunged off into the cave enjoying the glowworms and streamway. Much to our distress though, this large, never-flooding cave soon became small and crawly, with pinecones and other flood debris embedded in the roof. After a couple of hours wandering around in this, everyone was starting to get the jitters and worry about flood risk. Luckily, we soon came to a daylight hole, and with some sketchy climbing and rigging on the part of both Lachlans, we were soon back on the surface. \n\nThe tomo we climbed through certainly wasn’t the Monster Mouth Entrance that we’d been aiming for! It was also now raining, so we were VERY glad to be out of this clearly flood-prone stretch of cave (it’s possible this was Weka Cave, not Commentary Cave). \n\nTo while away the afternoon, we went surface trogging amongst the many dolines on the hill. Chris and I found a couple of interesting holes that went nowhere, but we were soon recalled by Andy and Lachy, who wanted me to rig something interesting they’d found. Lachy reported that there was a 10m pitch just past a small squeeze, and pointed me at it to rig it. I excitedly dived in, contorting myself and my SRT kit through the squeeze to find a delectably dead-end chamber with no pitch. Suspicious giggling noises were heard outside, and soon a grumpy Bailey was pointed at the actual 10m pitch, all of 3m away. This went down a nasty slot to a dead end chamber, with a side chamber that connected into the pitch half way down. \n\nDefinitely a cave (it even connected back into the small practical joke hole from earlier), and if it was Mount Fairy, we’d even give it a name (Andy found it, and offered Peanut Butter Pit because of the peanut butter coloured cave coral). But this is New Zealand, so we can’t even put a tag on it- apparently the Kiwis tried plastic tags and decided they didn’t like them. You need to try metal tags, people! We faffed around our new cave a little bit (we were pretty confident no one had been down there), pushing any lead we could. But they all died, and this cold, damp work eventually caused us to retreat off the hill, back to the cars, and up to the hut. \n\nOn the way back, we discovered that the (electric) fences in the farmer’s paddock had migrated slightly, and were mobbed by curious cows looking for something to eat. We decided that discretion was the better part of valour, and didn’t hang around to give them a chance to find out what caver tastes like. \n\nBeef snags (take that cows!) with veggies, rice and gravy for dinner; the gravy was yummy. Chris and I went to contact Whitley while dinner was cooking and check out her plans for Saturday. Lachy and Andy finished the cooking. Got back to find mere scrapings left, although the other two protested that this represented ‘half’. Chris also offered up his highest praise ever for my driving; apparently it was ‘tolerable’ in the Camry (**Lachie, note on behalf of Chris:** praise retracted on Wednesday the week after). \n\n***6-9-19 (Friday): Bushwalk (err..tramping) Day!***\n\n**Lachie:** Today dawned wet again, so we decided it was bushwalk day, although we did nearly take the cop-out option of Cabbage Pot and Earl Grey instead. Headed back down the hill to the west to Takaka township, and kept on going to Golden Bay. Lovely countryside; if it wasn’t for all the damn sandflies, I think I could live here! Also got final confirmation from Whitley that she was coming- the next day! We all agreed that booking international flights within 24h of the flight departing was cutting it a teeny bit fine… We were tossing up between Parapara Peak and Farewell Spit. Farewell Spit won, as I protested that I didn’t want to do a 18km walk with 1km of elevation gain when there was no possibility of views. Chris was disappointed. \n\nThe country out on Farewell Spit was really pretty, and Andy, Chris and Lachy were raring for the bushwalk. And not really patient for me, as I mucked around with the range of tech that I was keen to hang off myself prior to departing (camera, GPS, phone…). Chris led off, and we headed off to Fossil Point as the chosen destination. Well, for 200m at least anyway, because we took a wrong turn and followed the southern beach of Farwell Spit. This was adjudicated to be an agreeable mistake, and we continued to cruise out along the beach, enjoying the birds, shells and mudflats. Eventually the Spit Walk crosses Farewell Spit, and we enjoyed exploring the massive bald sand dunes around here. Lunch was had on the highest point we could find, with majestic views back to Visitor’s Centre, and out to the end of Farewell Spit. \n\nWe’d slightly deviated off the track at this point, so after lunch, headed in a straight line back to the beach (and track). We were all enjoying cruising along the open sand-dunes and swales at our own pace, when there was a massive shout and squelching noise from Andy at the back. Funny, there hadn’t been any lakes around. Turns out we had wandered into the middle of a massive quicksand bog, and Andy was the first to stand still long enough to find out about it. Rather than wear his gumboots, Andy was wearing his sandals over his joggers (because apparently neither were suitable for a bushwalk), and the sand had just tried to claim both. And Andy’s leg. \n\nThis was of course good amusement for the rest of us, and we stood around watching the show and laughing at him as he tried to get his equilibrium back. Fun for the first 30 seconds anyway, as soon we’d all been standing still for too long, and all started having issues too. So the next 15 minutes were enjoyed squelching our way through the quicksand, laughing at each other. Thankfully, it wasn’t real bad quicksand, although it could have killed you if you tried, or if you were on your own. No one ended up in deeper than thigh deep, although I did nearly face-plant into it all. We got to the beach, and regrouped at the DON’T GO PAST THIS SIGN sign, and I washed all the quicksand out of my boots. Chris then decided to find out how far he could walk back along the beach with his eyes closed, in a straight line. He managed about 4.5km, or until he ran out of beach. Unfortunately there wasn’t much straight line to be seen, and everyone had a wonderful time laughing as he obliviously walked into sandbanks and driftwood. Back to the cars via the Puponga Hilltop Walk, and a quiet drive back to the hut. Or at least for Chris and Andy anyway- I got sick of Andy’s music, and when Andy went to sleep, replaced it with a horror podcast at full-volume (so I could hear it over the rain, of course). \n\n***7-9-19 (Saturday): Eds Cellar***\n\n**Lachie:** Off down the hill at horrendousAM to pick Whitley up at Nelson airport. The others declined to accompany me, and went and did the Takaka Hill Walkway instead. Aimed to get into Nelson at 9am, so that I’d be there when Whitley arrived, but didn’t account for the roadworks at the bottom of Takaka Hill, so got there just after she had left the airport. I figured I’d have a bit of spare time, but also didn’t account for the small airport factor (I may also have gotten lost in Richmond). Listened to Alice Isn’t Dead on the way down, so that I could tell my sister what I thought of it. Pretty good, although I guess it’ll have to wait for me to get back to Canberra to finish it. We visited the market in Nelson on the way back to Motueka to meet the others at Maccas- it was a fantastic market. Was slightly out of it though, after a week of caving, the whole bustle of commerce thing was rather ethereal. \n\nAfter more shopping at Motueka, we all trooped off back up the hill to the cottage. It was early afternoon, so we dropped Whitley off at the cottage for a nap (she hadn’t slept since Canberra), and continued on to go caving. Target for today: Eds Cellar, which you get to from the Harwood Hole carpark. It’s a nice 1.5km walk along farm tracks to the cave, which is in a well-cloaked doline. The first pitch is just inside the cave, and Andy fell asleep at the top of it while waiting, bailing out of the cave. Down to three now… We got to Grannies Grotto before turning around. Back to the hut to meet a just-awakened Whitley, and a late dinner at about 9:30pm. \n\n*(Intermission)*\n\n**Andy:** About now Lachie’s laptop ran out of power. And we were far too lazy to write anything up on paper after consistently returning to the hut exhausted. So I’m writing the following entries in December 2019, long after the trip. Admittedly, it would have been a lot nicer to have done this a few months ago while the memories from the trip were still fresh. But this is the best I can do for now. I’ll try to keep it brief so as to not unintentionally give a false recount of events. \n\n***8-9-19 (Sunday): Riwaka Resurgence***\n\n\n**Andy:** Sunday was the best day yet, a comment I made many times on the trip because the caves just kept on getting better and better! We drove to the base of the hill to attempt the mighty Riwaka Resurgence, the spot where all of the caves on Takaka Hill comes to an end. There was a very large flow rate of water surfacing from the very base of the hill. In previous years, this had been the entrance for cave divers into the cave, the only who could get in. And what a mighty current they would have had to fight. We walked through the lovely rainforest up the hill a few hundreds meters on a small track that took us to Simply Sumpless, a humble hole in the ground. Simply Sumpless had only been discovered in recent years, and the dense rainforest it was buried in indicated why. We climbed steeply down a series of squeezes very similar to Rho Hole at Jenolan. It was very unlike NZ because of all of the squeezing, and felt very much like home. That was until we reached the bottom of the climb. What came next was amazing. \n\nWe plunged into a massive room, much larger than the one with the Lighthouse Pitch, although not quite as high. There was a loud, large flowing river through a rock pile and past a magnificent chunk of pure flowstone where we took a few pictures, which did not do the creature any justice. We climbed up the other side of the cavern and navigated through large boulders to another large room about 15m high. Lachie and Whitley sat down for a small nap while Chris and I went down a path that was full of formation. Returning to Lachie and Whitley we realised that Lachy had already proceeded further into the cave and climbed a mammoth rock pile. It was unfortunate Lachie and Whitley didn’t make it into the next chamber, mere meters away, because it is a room I don’t think I will ever forget. \n\nWe climbed a large rock pile and in front of us was a perfectly smooth wall. Unlike anything we had seen before, the wall was 10m2, a completely flat surface. All of the marble rocks we were climbing on were perfect cuboids, with sharp edges and vertices as if we were in a giant’s Lego playground. The ceiling had holes in it the shape of cubes, the same shape as the rubble we were climbing through. The boulders were a few meters in diameter. It was astonishing how clean cut all of the objects were. We failed to find a rope to the next passage hidden amongst the boulders. Apparently just a couple of years ago this was a walk through passage. And so (presumably from an earthquake), all of these rocks had fallen recently, and had fractured at very clean cut shear planes – especially for the massive wall which nothing short of a large shear plane! You really wouldn’t want to be there the day the roof caves in, which could be any day, as the cave would rain thousands of tonnes of rock on you, and if lucky enough to safely shelter, would’ve definitely lost all hearing! \n\n***9-9-19 (Monday): Middle Earth Again***\n\n**Andy:** We decided to drive back to Middle Earth, nearby. We had planned to go here anyway as we had left the 54m rope rigged on our last trip, which was near the entrance. It was also another chance to get in the cave. This was a pleasant trip as we were already partially familiar with the route. It was also nice to show Whitley the cave. We went up through the Eco Pitch / Enviro Pitch, didn’t have time to revisit the Lighthouse Pitch, but got another glimpse at Benoir’s sex dungeon *(Ed: Pickford’s Parlour, good to see that I’m not alone in slander)*, which beside its dirty history was definitely a highlight of the trip (also, not a very comfortable place to get it on). It was a room packed to the brim with flowstone and a perfectly still reservoir immersed amongst rimstone pools. There was even a little beach. It was here we turned around and came out of Hobbit Hole again, this time in daylight. \n\nWhen it was time to collect the rope, Lachy and I thought it would be fun to see how quickly we could race down, collect the rope and race back up through the rock pile (now laden with a heavy rope bag). We managed to get down and up in 7 minutes, subtract the time it took to pull up the rope from the 40m pitch. Surprisingly, it took only about 30sec extra on the way up with the bag. Interestingly, gravity was not a major factor affecting our time, rather it was remembering the route on the way down! \n\n\n***10-9-19 (Tuesday): Eds Cellar with Dive Tanks, and Corkscrew***\n\n**Andy:** We heard that Chris and Lachy had a pretty sporty day in Corkscrew, but Lachie’s and my journey through Ed’s Cellar nearby, was an absolute epic. We had already been to Ed’s Cellar, where I had conked out from a powerful food coma at the entrance. This time we offered to help Kieran Mckay, a very experienced NZ caver, do an exploratory dive in a stream only found a few weeks earlier. We were joined by Chris Whiting. This was the best day of caving yet, again. And it completely squeezed it out of us. It involved lots of crawling through passageways, pitches and most importantly, fighting through powerful waterfalls, all with heavy dive equipment. \n\nOnce we reached the bottom we were very cold because we had just been baptised by a wall of water. So we very much appreciated the thermos tea Chris had to share around. Kieran’s dive was short because the passage narrowed at the bottom, where he would need a different set of kit next time. Prusiking back up the waterfalls was again an immense challenge and despite the waterproof overalls, there was nowhere the water couldn’t reach. We arrived on the sun setting and I had a wonderful chat with Kieran. He used to run leadership training trips down Harwoods Hole for soon-to-be NZ Army Generals. He told me that they were more scared caving than when under fire by the enemy! \n\nWe arrived back at the carpark to meet the fellas from Corkscrew, and drove back to Whitley, who was taking a rest day. \n\n**Lachy:** Corkscrew cave was an interesting cave. We’d been told of many bolts but were surprised to find that we had to go off natural rigging points most of the time (and unfortunately, we didn’t bring much tape). Given we had mostly brand new 9mm rope we spent a lot of time carefully choosing rigging points and using advanced techniques to minimise rubbing (e.g. shoving a bag between the rope and a corner). \n\nChris took charge and got us most of the way down until we found some precarious bolts. The bolts were a few metres out from a safe ledge and directly above a 15m or so drop. I tied myself in and carefully made my way across knowing that if I fell, I would swing back and feel some pain. I was bridging across, but it got a bit too wide. I ended up smearing one foot with the other foot on a tiny little ledge. I reached out and managed to get a carabiner into a bolt and descended feeling relieved. \n\nChris then jumped on rope and said some notable things such as “this is the most precarious position I’ve ever been” and “you are crazy” as he made his way across to the bolt. He turned around only to notice an extra bolt hidden away that would make the whole thing far safer and easier. I came back up and we rigged it again with that bolt. Chris came down and went down one more pitch but then we decided it was time to head back to the surface. Overall it was a good cave, but we wish we had come with more tape!\n\n***11-9-19 (Wednesday) and 12-9-19 (Thursday): Castle Rocks Tramping***\n\n**Andy and Lachie:** After a very physically intense day on Tuesday we decided to go for a tramp. We had been planning to walk up to Mount Arthur Hut and frolic in the snow, but after an hours’ drive, we got to the Graham Valley Road and discovered Flora Saddle was closed for roadworks. So around we turned, and back up the Hill it was for option two, Castle Rocks. On the drive we stopped at the Ngarua Cave lookout, where we ate the usual cheese and salami with bread rolls (this time with added lettuce). \n\nWe parked at the Harwoods Hole carpark, and began our delightful walk through the bush. There were wonderful views all around (the default for tramping in New Zealand), with the snowcapped ranges of Kahurangi National Park on the other side of the Takaka Valley forming a wall to the world. Eventually the views of distant mountains were overtaken by beech forest, which seemed amazingly verdant and lush to Australians used drought-stressed gumtrees. There was plenty of interesting stuff to look at, with many small bush birds and plenty of fungi along the track. \n\nWe just made it to Castle Rock Hut on the Abel Tasman Inland Track just before dusk. Everyone agreed that it was an excellent track- plenty of roots and mud bogs to keep everything interesting, but never overgrown enough that you actually had to fight your way through the bush. The hut was very nicely set up, and had a very high tech fireplace which made it unbearably hot at night due to the lack of ventilation. As usual, Chris slept in his bivvy on the patio! \n\nAs the first thing in the morning, we went out to see the view from the Castle Rocks that Castle Rock Hut is (not quite exactly) named after. This had prime views out to the east of the ocean and nearby snowy peaks. The beautiful scenery bestowed an instant case of itchy-feet, and the walk back was full of discussion about more ambitious walking ideas, like the Dusky Track, the Overland Track, and the Australia Alps Walking Track. Chris had already ran to the lookout the night before and was feeling equally ambitious. So, instead of returning the way we had come like the rest of us, he completed a much larger loop and actually beat us to the car! We had been very slow at packing up in the morning… Or at least that was the excuse anyway. \n\n***13-9-19 (Friday): HARWOODS HOLE!***\n\n**Andy:** Today was the day of all days. The cave of all caves. Harwood’s Hole. This trip had been anticipated for months, and we had debated regularly over whether we should actually do it. Lachie in particular was worried about the rope dynamics, and that it was too dangerous, and, and much more. \n\nUnfortunately Chris was feeling unwell with a bad case of the chuck-ups, and stayed at the hut. In hind-sight was a very good idea. \n\nTo get to the hole, you have to for about 45 minutes. I carried the 200m rope on my back, which was the largest cave pack I have even seen. When we arrived at the hole we were blown away by its sheer size and even though we could not yet see to the bottom, it was already quite nerve-wracking. It took a little while to find the bolts at the top of the pitch, and Lachie mistakenly started rigging the wrong approach gully off natural anchors. This wasted a bit of time, but he did find a very expensive drone that someone had lost to Harwoods Hole.\n\nNevertheless, we eventually got it, and rigged everything up. While looking for the actual bolts, we found a few climbing bolts that traversed up the wall over the hole – which was crazy! We rigged a 60m rope as well as the 200m rope for the purposes of rope recovery. We decided to communicate by clapping rocks as no voice can be heard down 200m vertical meters, and one of the two whistles had been misplaced *(Ed: read as dropped down the hole)*. \n\nThe descent took me half an hour. Half an hour of non-stop abseiling. 173m vertical. It was very slow because of the 20kg of rope below our racks. But the view was astonishing. It was absolutely incredible. I had no idea what a 200m pitch would look like. I find it very hard to describe because everything was so distant. I thought, boy I’ll never see something like this ever again. I thought, ‘I’ve seen it all now!’. I did what any kid would want to do and when I was on rope at the top, I spat and watched and waited for the spit to reach the bottom. After about a minute of watching the droplet in freefall I got bored and gave up on watching it, concluding perhaps it will never reach the bottom! Then I lost sight of it. You would barely spot a human at the bottom from up there. \n\nLachy went down first to set up a belay, and was the fastest. Then Whitley went down, having a frustrating abseil as she had to haul herself nearly all the way down. I followed Whitley, and then Lachie brought up the  rear. He took 45 minutes, as he had to set up a re-belay, and got a bad case of rope-spin. The re-belay is needed for a minor rub point about 40m down, and is a precaution in case we needed to prusik upwards in an emergency. God help anyone who ends up in that situation! 60m is enough *(Ed: Andy, you did the Lighthouse pitch a week and a half ago, that was 110m)*! At the top it was very scary because, well, there was 200m below you, and you get on rope at a 30cm ledge above free-fall. My hands were cramping up when trying to begin the descent because of the weight of the rope. But about 20 minutes into the abseil I had completely lost feeling in my legs. Reaching the bottom, while a relief, was quite painful as a result. \n\nWhen we were all down we had bite to eat and it was time to exit through Starlight Cave, completing our through-trip. This cave easily had the best formation of any cave I have ever seen. And the water was a perfect blue. The cave was very fun because there were rope swings over water and a few spots where we had to bridge the water using narrow ledges. We had been told it was a quick 3 hour trip through Starlight. It took us a lot longer, which naturally made us a bit worried. There was lots of gushing water and waterfalls so we got wet very quickly. Eventually Lachie started to worry we had lost the way, the map was deteriorating from the water and mud, and we were already running a few hours later than planned. Despite my growing concern, Lachy was content to continue trudging through. \n\nLachy and I lost Whitley and Lachie off ahead and as we found out later, Lachie had been on the cusp of hypothermia from a shock plunge into a pool. We were expecting a walk through (except the Blasted Squeeze) due to miscommunications with the Kiwis, but there were a few small crawls and squeezes sowing doubt in our minds. So we were extremely relieved when we got to the reflective marker pointing up to it and discovered that no, we were where we thought we were. \n\nPast the Blasted Squeeze (it was blasted open, and is also blasted, as it is small and wet) the cave got even more wet, with several big deep pools to swim. This was fun of course, alongside the many destroyed ropes, some of which didn’t even have sheaths anymore *(Ed: NSG is planning to remove all the tatty old rope in Harwoods Hole/Starlight Cave, as there have been several nasty accidents because of it. So bring your own! We did use some of the in situ rope, but only after assessing it, and had our own rope too)*! \n\nThe swims were spectacular, long deep and narrow with flowstone all round, but very cold, so that by the end Lachy and I were a little chilled but in a manageable state. Lachie and Whitley are a lot skinnier than us, and were definitely in a rush to get out, hence leaving us. I will never be more relieved to see the exit of a cave than this one, after a very stressful day. Starlight had taken about 4 hours. While 4 hours is not much for a cave, we had also spent a few hours at the top of the hole, and still had to de-rig and walk back.\n \nBut the day wasn’t over yet. We had exited out the side of a mountain into a deep gorge. We walked/climbed past a small helipad painted on one of the rocks, evidence of just how dangerous the cave can be to unprepared groups. Now we begin our ascent in the dark and light rain for the remaining 500 vertical meters back up the hill. It was very steep going, with lots of loose rock and very dense bush off the vague track.  \n\nWe split up, Lachy and I ahead of the others, to go and de-rig. Lachy and I loved the climb up the hill. We were both very low on energy to the point where Lachy may not have made it up the hill if it weren’t for the remaining muesli bar. For the others the climb wasn’t as pleasant, which is fair given their condition and how steep and slippery the hill was. We were blessed with reflective markers on trees on the way out. If they had not been there we most certainly wouldn’t’ve made it back. Our lights were very dim, and once Lachy replaced his battery we could actually see the markers again. \n\nLachy and I went to de-rig while the others would go back to the car, call Chris Whiting and let us know that we had made it out. Although Lachy and I had quite a task ahead of us, and we were already very low on energy. I remember we had thought it was too dark and wet to go and retrieve the rope. That was until we reminded ourselves that we were cavers and actually most of our rope work takes place in cold and dark places! \n\nThe rope took a couple of hours to haul up and much credit to Lachy who bore the main brunt of the hauling. I was simply stuffing the rope in the bag! Although given the conditions, even this was far from an easy task. It did go quite quickly, as tasks do when you’re exhausted. \n\nWe returned to the carpark and were met by a very relieved Lachie just short of the Hole, as he was worried about how long we had taken. Apparently, he’d been worrying about us since we left back down at the helipad. Packing up and getting changed, I took my gloves off and noticed for the first time since the whole trip that my dermatitis had reached extreme levels without my noticing… To top such an incredible day off, I now had gruesome hands with red flesh visible! Chris Bradley was relieved to see us when we returned at night, but had thankfully not launched a one-man rescue mission. It has to have been the most action-packed day of my life, and I’m sure not far off for the others! We all collapsed into bed very quickly after getting back, leaving an ominous pile of dirty caving gear.\n\n**Lachie:** Here are some notes on times for the trip, based on my camera’s photos. We left the NSG Hut about 7:30am, and got back at 11:30pm that night- a 16h round trip, that ideally would have taken about 10h. \n\n•\t45min from car to top of Harwood Hole\n\n•\tAbout 2h, 20min rigging, 45min of that probably being me in the wrong gully\n\n•\t2h, 45min to get us all to the bottom\n\n•\t40min from bottom of pitch to Twin Falls\n\n•\t3h from Twin Falls to the Starlight entrance helipad\n\n•\tProbably 3h from here back to the cars, including derigging \n\n***14-9-19 (Saturday): Cleaning Like Hell***\n\n**Andy:** Thoroughly caved out from our excessive underground indulgences over the past two weeks, we still had a lot of cleaning to do if we were to have a chance of getting through customs! We utilised the tank fed sinks while rigorously brushing all of our gear, then hanging it up to dry around the fire. The drying was slow, and ropes took a long time to clean by hand. We also made sure to eat all the remaining food we had, although Whitley was very unimpressed by Lachie putting peaches in a curry. \n\nIn the evening, we returned to Christchurch, dropping the Harwoods rope off to Chris Whiting in Richmond, and paying the hut fees to Greg Pickford. Getting back over Lewis Pass was a bit dicey due to snow, but thankfully the snow plough had just been through and the road was open. \n\n***15-9-19 (Sunday): Returning Home***\n\n**Andy:** We had dinner and waited a few hours overnight for our flight at Maccas in Christchurch, where we had spent our first night. It wasn’t the most ideal place to spend my birthday **(Lachie, Chris, Lachy and Whitley:** HAPPY BIRTHDAY ANDY!), but there were plenty of family deals to share around so not many complaints from me! We then attempted to have a nap in the cars for about an hour before we drove to the airport and broke off. Lachie and Whitley were to head to Auckland, while the others went home. The trip home was a great time to get some rest. The customs had absolutely no issues with us, even having declared caving, and didn’t even look at our caving gear! If only they had known where we had been! All of the cleaning was for nothing… \n\nWell, there’s one thing I can say. It was quite a trip. ;)"

    "body": "Once again the annual SUSS cave surveying course was back through popular demand. I went along because I’ve picked up a taste for cave surveying- that’s what happens when you gatecrash too many SUSS trips. Seeing as I have a handful of survey projects on the go, I reckoned it would be good to have a better understanding of surveying so I could teach other NUCCers how it works. The course was ably run by Phil Maynard, Jill Rowling and Mike Lake.\n\nI rocked up on Friday arvo, and for several hours Em Butcher (SUSS) and I were the only people there. We relaxed in the luxurious cottage SUSS and MSS had booked for the weekend, and drank our way through three bottles of whiskey. At least that’s what the evidence suggested when everyone else turned up…\n\nSaturday morning had an early start with a presentation on how to do surveying with a Disto. Soon enough we were all in Victoria Arch surveying away in a neat little side passage. After a break for lunch, we finished the surveying for the day, and returned to the cottage for another presentation, this time on how to reduce survey data to put into Survex. Dinner was a mixed affair, ranging from gourmet cooking to leftovers and 2-minute noodles. After dinner, we all got a wonderful introduction to the headache that is trying to reduce your survey data into a useable format!\n\nSunday was entirely spent drawing the maps up, using old fashioned pens and tracing film. While more modern ways to draw maps exist, they were beyond the scope of the course. With plenty of help from our instructors, soon enough we all had passable maps. It was very interesting that although we had all mapped the same chunk of passageway, the maps were all extremely different! \n\nWe all left with a much better understanding of how cave mapping works, and (hopefully) the skills to do it on our own. The weekend was fantastically well planned and organised- thanks again to Phil, Mike and Jill, but also to Marilyn Scott from MSS who did most of the background admin work. There’s a good chance SUSS will be running another course in late October next year, so if you’re interested have a chat to SUSS early in 2020. \n\nThe cost of the course was about $100, for cottage hire and equipment, and comes highly recommended by me! If you’re interested in surveying but can’t make the course, I do have the course notes too, which provide much good information. I’ve included the map I made as hopeful incentive for other NUCCers to come surveying with me!"

    "body": "Glenlyon and Viator Caves (collectively Texas Caves) are south-eastern Queensland’s most significant cave systems. Unfortunately, they were flooded by the construction of Glenlyon Dam in the mid 1970s. This was an act of blatant environmental vandalism that the local caving club, the University of Queensland Speleological Society (UQSS, since defunct), fought in vain against. The current drought has severely affected the region, with most of the catchment of Glenlyon Dam receiving 20-40% of mean rainfall in 2019, and 50-70% of mean rainfall over the past three years. This has caused an unusually low dam level, with under 5% storage levels for the past few months, and a current estimated level of 2.5%. The low dam levels presented a rare opportunity to visit the caves. Cathi Humphrey-Hood took this opportunity, organising a joint caving clubs trip, with members from MSS, NHVSS, SUSS, and myself from NUCC all trooping up to Texas Caves. So a big thank you to Cathi for putting in all the hard work to make the trip happen!\n\nBut anyway, how did I end up on the trip? Well, Chris Bradley and I helped with part of the packing up of the ASF library from Canberra in August. In the process, I pilfered borrowed a bunch of bits and pieces on areas I was interested in, including a stack of UQSS journals, as I was going up to Queensland in November to get my car some pretty maroon plates. I’d discovered that Glenlyon dam was very low, and thought it might make an interesting stop. Cathi spotted me stealing borrowing the journals, revealed she had something similar planned, and invited me along. Thanks Cathi, you might even get the library material back this decade! \n\nSo duly we all congregated at the caravan park at Glenlyon Dam. Some had easier trips than others- Phil Maynard coasted down from Toowoomba, while most of the other Sydneysiders and Novocastrians had to slog their way up the New England Highway. I should have had an easy trip, as I was already in south-eastern Queensland, but got geographically embarrassed by my assorted GPSes. Typically, I had 4 GPS units, several different paper maps (and a compass), and still found myself at the end of a dirt track, in a farmers field, past several creek-crossings, looking at a double-padlocked gate obstructing the way on at 10pm. Obviously, I was late, and missed the Friday arvo pleasure-cruise up the dam to do a reccie.\n\nSaturday morning was to be Viator Hill day, and started early with a tropical start, even though the Tropics are still 600km away. Who cares, with the drought and heatwave passing through, it was hot enough already. Gear was packed, and trucked down to the boatramp for a first shuttle run up the dam. Everyone else had to walk, especially the stragglers who showed up on Saturday morning just as we were about to leave. Thankfully, we only had to walk part way on the true-left bank of the dam, as the boat came back to meet us, and soon we were all up to Viator Hill. It was punishingly hot by this point, so most of us dived into the first cave we found, which happened to be Main Viator Cave (VR1). Only after GPSing it though- about ½ dozen GPS units had made the journey up the lake, and all were being put to good (redundant?) use.  \n\nMain Viator was a mudfest. Imagine the muddiest cave you can think of, and then make it worse. Well, so long as that muddiest cave isn’t at Jenolan, anyway. Main Viator is probably the lowest cave on Viator Hill, and is the former efflux of the system. It is large and predominately walk through, except for the bits where you have sunk up to the calves in mud and have to crawl. At a guess, I’d think the lowest parts of the floor were covered in an extra meter of mud caused by sediment from the dam. The lower entrance to Main Viator is almost always flooded and has numerous daylight holes, so I’d presume there is a constant and gradual sedimentation process as water slowly cycles through the cave from the dam. \n\nAfter Main Viator, we all split up and wandered over the hill to do our own things. Some surveyed, others trogged around trying to locate the known caves, some photographed, others lurked in the cave looking for any excuse not to go outside in the sun, and some valiantly sat in the shade of the few meagre trees on top of the hill and fought off the meat ants. If you weren’t on the trip, and can guess who-did-what correctly, I’ll buy you a bottle of (very cheap) wine (look, I’m a uni student, what do you expect, Penfolds Grange?). Hint: there were 4 surface troggers, 2 surveyors, 3 photofaffers, 2 cave sitters, and 2 shade sitters.\n\nA range of caves and probable looking holes were found, some even with tags intact. Glenlyon and Viator both use a different style of tags to the ones we’re all used to, with a long narrow strip of aluminium stamped with the cave name (but not number) held in place with a bolt (frequently steel) at each end. Most of them were badly corroded from immersion in the dam water, with the aluminium going soft and powdery, and the bolts being rusted. A large portion of them were missing, especially on the lower caves. These need urgent replacing before the dam rises, as for several caves, the only way we could positively locate them was due to the remains of the tags. \n\nThe dam water is evidently extremely aggressive, as much of the karren on the surface had dissolved or softened, and any surviving formation in the caves had a powdery, chalky consistency. Also, several tinnies were spotted that looked like they pretty much had the hull corroded off them! This is what causes the urgency for with the tags, as not only is it destroying the existing tags, but also evidence of where the tags were. \n\nEventually everyone congregated back around the second major cave on Viator Hill, Russenden Cave (VR2). This was clearly marked for visitation by dam users, with many driftwood sticks jammed into cracks around the cave, surmounted by beer cans and bottles. Great pleasure was had in tearing these down, although it is suspected that they will return in short order. Russenden Cave is higher up on Viator Hill, and had less of the thick, gloopy mud in it. However, the back reaches of the cave do seem to have had a moderate amount of in-fill by lake mud. The going theory for this was that as the entrance is one of the higher points of the cave, it fills rather dramatically, forcing the first sediment-filled water out to the end of the cave. Sadly, this once beautiful cave is being badly damaged by visitors now that the water levels are lower, with many signatures scrawled on the walls dated to 2019. Much more phototime was had nonetheless. \n\nFollowing Russenden and lunch, much of the group returned to Viator Main to watch (or photograph) Rod OBrien diving into the lower level of the cave, which was still completely flooded. A splinter group of Rod Smith, Phil, Anna and me went wandering around to look at the other caves. Bevans Pot (VR4) was found and investigated, and Crystal Cave (VR3) was found to be completely choked with sediment. Phil and Anna tried a short dig there, but it revealed only more mud and was aborted. After this, the sun was starting to get to the group, so rather than go look for some of the other caves, we went and hid in the most shady hole we could find while waiting for diving (and photos..) to happen.\n\nEventually the migration back to the boat for a lift back to shade, aircon, beer, cheese and crackers began, only to be slowed by a small problem- the boat wouldn’t start. An hour later, our poor struggling ride sputtered into life, and we all eventually go a lift back. Except for Keir, who got tired of the whole affair and walked back around the dam on his own. Cold drinks and a shower were definitely appreciated after a long (but successful) day in the sun. \n\nSunday dawned just as hot as Saturday, and was the Glenlyon day. We all loaded up the boat, and part of the group started walking. Glenlyon is just across the river to the north-west from Viator Hill, but this adds significant extra boat time. It was found to be quicker and easier to just ferry groups across the water on bends, walking most the way, rather than do long trips up and back. Because of the extra distance, we didn’t all get out there until late in the morning. \n\nGlenlyon was a major shock: out of all the caves visited, Glenlyon River Cave (GL1) was the lowest, and was only just above the water level. It is possible we were the first group to enter the cave since it was flooded- the dam has been down to 5% before, but never as low as 2%. The cave was known as a major, walk through river passage, with 30 entrances. Instead, we found a series of heavily silted dolines, and crawling passages that were nearly full of thick, waterlogged black mud. Any streamway in the cave more closely resembled puddles trapped behind banks of mud, perched potentially on meters of mud. It was horrible. This is what a dying cave looks like, and is the future that awaits all the caves on Viator Hill and at Glenlyon. It is only a matter of time, rather than destiny. \n\nDisheartened by the caves, heat, and long trip back, we retreated to the cabins to drown our sorrows in an early and extended happy hour. The boat performed admirably this time, with no motor troubles at all. Morale was regained with the discovery the Kiosk sells cheap and tasty icecream (the macadamia comes highly recommended). Showers were had, the museum visited, and the first people departed south. \n\nMost of the group stayed the night, and departed on Monday, with a splinter party also visiting Ashford Caves on the way home. Ashford Cave (AS1) was rather interesting, but bears the scars of receiving too many visitors- broken formation, scrawled signatures, the usual. Garry enjoyed taking photos for his book. There is actually a significant amount of limestone at Ashford, but much of it is on private land, and the area would be well worth another, more prolonged visit if access permission to trog this could be arranged. \n\nAfter Ashford, we all went our separate ways, and I headed back to Canberra via Gunnedah, scoring a 6th flat tyre in 2 years about 10km east of town (five out of the six have been on caving trips). It was a total writeoff (catastrophic sidewall puncture), and likely has done nothing to improve my driving reputation. \n\nThe trip was an excellent opportunity to visit some caves that are rarely visited by organised speleos now. We got a lot done, and made some excellent progress towards updating the documentation of Glenlyon and Viator Hill caves to a modern standard. There is however, much more that needs be done there, and barring a wet summer, I think it very likely someone will be making a return trip in 2020. \n\nA shortlist of tasks that need be undertaken at Glenlyon Caves and Viator Hill would be:\n\n•\tGPS references for the caves need to be verified, as several caves are yet to be relocated \n\n•\tAccurate cave entrance height data needs to be gathered, as well as for features around the dam wall\n\n•\tAll the caves need to be re-tagged with marine grade stainless steel tags\n\n•\tSeveral extra features need to be tagged, and possibly dug\n\n•\tSome sort of notice could be placed in Russenden Cave asking visitors not to graffiti the cave\n\n•\tFour smaller limestone outcrops separate from the two main outcrops need to be trogged\n\n•\tSeveral smaller caves seemingly don’t have maps, and making a record of them could be useful\n\n•\tNew maps of Russenden Cave and Glenlyon River Cave would be very valuable, to document the effect of the dam on the cave passages\n\n•\tCavers could investigate landholders on either side of the dam to see if it is possible to establish 4WD access within 1-2km of the caves"

    "body": "With seemingly every other caving area in the state on fire or already burnt, I headed up to Abercrombie Caves for a weekend caving. This was an MSS trip to work on their book, but they kindly let me come along, as they needed a keen, thin and flexible caver to survey Rabbit Trap cave. Met up with Marilyn Scott and Dave Stuckey from MSS on Friday morning, and we headed down to one of the outlying bluffs to look for some missing caves. About 5 caves were missing, and we found two of them, climbing over the bluffs in grueling 40+ degree heat.\n\nThe tagging at Abers is a little haphazard- the original taggers were determined to reach 100 tags, so happily tagged wombat holes and anything else that looked remotely like a tag. However once they reached 100, enthusiasm obviously waned, because there are still many wombat holes that they didn’t grace with tags. Even David, who was responsible for placing some of the tags, was looking at them and asking himself “What were we thinking?”\n\nWe couldn’t survive very much of this, so after maybe an hour on the bluffs and finding two tags, we beat a very brave retreat back to the cottage to sit in the shade and have cool showers. Well, not so much the cool shower bit- the pipes to the cottage are in full sun and the water was hot enough to make tea with by the time it came out of the tap. Garry Smith and Marcia from NHVSS showed up, and the afternoon was spent inside with the fan on. Real hardcore caving this… As the youngest person on the trip, I soon started collecting advice from the old fogeys *cough* experienced cavers. Apparently I need to get superannuation ASAP, and the fact that I don’t have any is horrific (the fact that I have no income to put into it evidently doesn’t matter). David, Marilyn and I went up to the Trunkey Pub for dinner, and it still does excellent pub grub. I was on the receiving end of more unsolicited advice there too, with instructions to never buy a farm, and never take up shearing.\n\nThat evening, we visited Long Tunnel (A4), a passageway off the side of the Arch. Special access was granted for the Abers book, and we could only enter the cave after 10pm, as it is the site of a major bat roost. The passageway was both extremely batty and dusty, causing several jokes about histoplasmosis that had me just coughing my lungs up with laughter (yeah, sorry, not sorry). I still had fun with several sketchy climbs, one of which was totally rotten from bat piss, and the other of which had no handholds about 4m in the air. Fun.\n\nSaturday was the big project work day, and groups went everywhere: photos in the Arch, surveying in the Arch, surface surveying near the Arch, and geology on top of the Arch. I headed up to Rabbit Trap (A42) a tight cave that MSS agreed to let me survey suspiciously quickly. Arriving there, it became abundantly clear why- the entrance was comfortably body sized, but inside I had a wonderful selection of bedrock flatteners to choose from. There was only one ‘chamber’ where it was just possible to sit and sketch. This meant that it was exceedingly slow, as the sketchbook and the survey were usually on opposite sides of a squeeze or flattener. Eventually I got jammed, gave up, and headed down to the Arch to see what everyone else was up to. Typically, the cave goes on the other side of a squeeze, so I guess I’ll be back with a microbod.\n\nDown at the Arch, Phil Maynard, Alan Pryke and Marilyn had gotten distracted from their survey by a potential lead that would ordinarily have been obscured by water. This was more interesting than my plans to survey a possible extension in Stable Cave (A26), so I crashed their lead. More fun sketchy scrambling and we got to a seeming dead end with a breeze. Alan investigated this, proclaimed that he was going to die if he tried getting through it, and went through it anyway (complaining all the while). This revealed a nasty muddy pit, which sadly dead ended (guess which idiot got sent down to investigate). The breeze vanished, and we thought it was coming down through the mud and rock roof.\n\nThe afternoon was getting on, so we called it quits after that, and everyone trooped up to the cottage for happy hour. Alas, we had another date with Long Tunnel that evening, this time to survey it. So once again, we trogged up and were heading underground at 10pm. Marilyn and I drew the short straw, and were dispatched to survey from the far end of Long Tunnel, meeting up with the others at the batty chamber. This took us until well the other side of 1am, as it was quite tight.\n\nThe midnight caving session meant a slow start for Sunday morning. Eventually everyone was moving, and we all congregated in the Arch. Some useful bunnies sped along with the survey, but others of us were content to just sit and watch the show. Lassitude eventually overtook the trip, and we all finished up our tasks just after midday to head home."

I was with a friend, fully intending on going to the mountaineering stand when I suddenly found myself not only holding a caving flyer, but also committing to attend the first caving trip of the year – the beginners Mount Fairy one.\n\nBetween saying that I would attend and stepping out of a car at Mount Fairy, I thought remarkably little about what I had signed up to. I knew that I had to get some batteries and had a vague memory of walking through an old mine near Broken Hill. As such, my only guesses about the upcoming experience was that it would be dark, that people would be pointing out things on walls and that I’d be following people around.\n\nWell, while it turns out that these three guesses are key components of being in a cave, the experience was significantly more engaging than I could have guessed. Almost immediately, I found myself going through a squeeze that was not only surprisingly long – but also rather difficult to get through. The novelty of being in a situation where I felt both incredibly exposed and as though I was experiencing something unique was exhilarating.\n\nThe rest of the trip followed a similar pattern. As someone who is notoriously bad at spotting animals, the reality that we saw a wombat (in its house!) and had to change plans as a result of this encounter was embarrassingly exciting. The opportunity to hike up mud slides and shimmy through puddles was also wonderful.\n\nI don’t think that I expected the trip to be particularly engaging. Before being at Mount Fairy, I associated caves primarily with planked footpaths, slightly bored guides and the multitude of ways people rhyme the difference between stalagmites and stalactites. The reality that we scrambled out of a variety of caves, covered in mud was utterly unexpected.\n\nThe Mount Fairy trip was a wonderful introduction to the idea of caving. It was accessible enough to not be overwhelming, but also diverse enough for everyone to see the opportunities associated with continuing to cave. The fact that we also saw an echidna on the drive home was the cherry on the top."

    "body": "This was one of the first trips of the year after Market Day, so it was a big four-car convoy that left the regroup point at Robertson. We were relieved that the smoke had now definitely cleared and the fires had stopped – even on Market Day, it hadn’t been entirely certain whether the trip would go ahead. We were not alone. It seemed that everyone this side of Sydney was eager to make the most of what now remained of summer, and the road through Macquarie Pass was busy. The tiny carpark at the canyon trailhead was crammed to overflow. Our four cars obviously didn’t fit, and we shuffled three of them to the exit straightaway and left one on the road shoulder. \n\n\nThe atmosphere of our group was friendly and excited; for many, it was their first time canyoning. While the first pitch was rigged with a dry route and harnesses were fine-tuned, some of the more experienced canyoners abseiled directly down the waterfall. There had been precious little opportunity this summer to experience that feeling of water spray as the rope slides through your rack, your harness takes your weight and you step back over the edge – it was good to savour that now.\n\nAt the bottom, treading water, I fumbled with my rack. I was a bit out of practice, and slower than I would have liked in getting the bars off as I tried not to inhale the waterfall pouring down the rocks. Much later in coronavirus lockdown, reading a canyoning book written by a New Zealander, it was interesting to note that over there they prefer figure-8 descenders and rigging the rope, without the end knotted, to hang just touching the surface of the water. That way, canyoners simply abseil straight off the end of the rope into the pool. In New Zealand, where the volume of water barrelling through a canyon is much greater than here, it seems that faffing with rack bars under a waterfall is much more dangerous and best avoided.\n\n\nThe middle sections of the canyon passed smoothly in a series of abseils and one optional jump-slide – each one framed by dark rock, white water and verdant bush. With the excuse of nursing a camera, I avoided the jump and took photos of others down the bottom instead. Our group became faster and more efficient at getting down the pitches as we made our way through the canyon, but by the final pitch, shivers and stomach rumbles were inevitable. We had intended to do the canyon as several sub-groups leapfrogging ropes, but the number of other groups in the canyon had made that impossible and turned the trip into a long day. \n\nI was impressed by the walk out – no huge, near-vertical uphill slog like Bungonia; no marathon cross-country bush-bash like Claustral. Instead it was a mild, short walk along a tourist path to the carpark. Lolly snakes were shared around and dry clothes gratefully put on. It was a great trip to start the year and introduce many new club members to the sport. "

Well, in the 20th century, these caves were used as dumping grounds by the landowner at the time where anything from old shoes to entire cars could be made to disappear! Not long after the cave system became an attractive location to cavers for exploration. Fast forward to the 1990’s where several caving and Scout groups came together over two weekends to haul a lot of the rubbish out. Since then there have been more informal efforts to make the space safer and more enjoyable. \n\nRecently I took a Cub Scout pack through there only to have them ask why these caves were littered with broken glass when none of the others had been. The disappointment of sharing the human impact people had had on the caves saddened me, however I did feel inspired when I told them the efforts people, including Scouts, had gone to so far to improve it. So much so that I was inspired to organise another clean up. With Clean Up Australia Day just around the corner, I thought it would be a great opportunity for ANUMC to participate. \n\nThere was a lot of enthusiasm from the club and talk of a possible collaboration with NUCC, who were only too keen to get involved. Leaders from both clubs worked hard to bring it all together. The 18 participants were split across three groups and were rotated between cleaning the trails around Dip Cave and caving in Gong Cave. The good vibes and great banter during the cave clean was fantastic! People were mining for ‘amber’ (pieces of glass bottles), and there were competitions of who could find the most interesting can of food or number of shoes. The caving groups enjoyed the caving ladder pitch into Gong Cave, and the formation in Gong Chamber, where total darkness with lights-out was experienced. \n\nThe groups stopped for a well deserved vegetarian barbeque lunch before heading back to the Dip Cave area for the afternoon session. All up we managed to collect six large tubs of rubbish, as well as a large pile of metal, which was removed from the site. Furthermore, this initiative sparked so much enthusiasm in ANUMC that the club is now looking to their next event, a clean up of the Queanbeyan River.\n\nI would like to thank ANUMC’s Committee for funding the barbeque lunch, the three NUCC leaders: Lachlan Bailey, Britt Brockett and Chris Bradley and the fourteen wonderful participants who volunteered their time. \n\f"

    "body": "The road to Wee Jasper passes through beautiful rugged country – I was impressed. Maybe it’s because I was used to driving to and from caving areas late at night with SUSS when the surrounding countryside is invisible. Nonetheless, the landscape here sits over fingers of limestone cut through by shale, pyroclastics and other things, and it does make for a scenic drive. \n\nWe set up camp when we got there and some more time was taken carrying rigging gear to the entrance of Punchbowl Cave only to realise a large school group were already getting ready to go into it. This may have been the same group whose tents we saw across the campground from ours, all identical and all neatly pitched in a row on a 45 degree slope. We hastily transferred gear to Dip Cave instead, and abseiled in. \n\nIt was the first time caving for some of the team, and dropping down into the first chamber on a rope was an impressive way to start. We pottered around some passages and did some jollying, turning away from one section because of bats. Dip Cave consists of a series of parallel sections, named ‘Series’, and we worked our way across them. \n\nWhen we made our way out, it was already evening. Everyone was tired and hungry; several pitches had made it a somewhat taxing day of caving, especially for those new to the sport (or those out of practice by about two years – i.e. myself). I ventured about the scaling poles we had still sitting in the back of our car, which had rattled with us all the way from Canberra and on which I had impaled my elbow several times getting in and out of the passenger seat. The plan had been to use them to reach a small but tantalising hole in Dip Cave, several metres above ground, over a sort of overhanging climb. The suggestion that we have a go at that now was mostly met with a reaction ranging somewhere from “that sounds interesting, but probably not for me,” to outright disgust.\n\nAs majority of the team headed back to camp, showers, dinner and a campfire, Gyver, Lachlan and myself carried the poles to the cave entrance and began what was probably the world’s worst attempt at scaling pole use in the history of caving. Neither Gyver nor myself had the faintest idea of how they were supposed to work. Lachlan had initially seemed to vaguely indicate that he had experience with them. It later turned out that his experience related more to disassembling scaling poles than to really setting them up or using them, and in fact this was probably the first time these particular poles were being used in several decades. \n\nThe enterprise began well. We devised a functional (and only slightly unsafe) method of lowering them down the entrance pitch into the cave, carabinered together and guided by one person standing on the chockstone halfway down. Ferrying them from the bottom of the pitch through a slot and into the chamber where they were needed also proceeded smoothly.\n \nThe trouble was that we assembled our poles on the ground, horizontally, but had no chance of levering the resulting monstrosity up several metres to reach the target hole. We had four poles bolted together; each an aluminium tube something like 10 cm round and 2 metres long. Together they were very heavy, very unwieldly, and very, very difficult to manoeuvre into place without obliterating formations from the roof or dropping it on our feet or heads – though we persevered, grunting with effort, for some time. In retrospect it is perhaps fortunate that we were unable to get the poles up to the hole because the whole structure may well have failed drastically when someone began to climb it. We lacked a spanner to tighten the bolts so Lachlan had used the pliers of his Leatherman to do it instead. I’m not sure how well the bolts would have held. Exhausted, and confused by the whole process, we dragged the poles back out of the pitch, de-rigged, and dragged ourselves back to camp. I couldn’t decide whether I wanted to join a SUSS trip involving scaling poles to learn how to use them properly, or whether to avoid such trips and never have to lay eyes on the darn things again.\n\nDay 2 began with a sleep-in. We then explored Punchbowl Cave – another fun cave for jollying. There was an informal climbing competition, followed by an informal squeezing competition (the latter somewhat strangely undertaken directly after lunch). There was an interesting grotto that was subsequently identified to be low in interest and high in bat poop. There was a sneaky climb to a little plateau looking over a large, formation-filled chamber criss-crossed by fluttering bats. There was a dubious flattener to a very dubious helictite. And there was the ‘Laundry Chute’, which some party members were enthralled by and others napped outside the entrance of. \n\nJust before we left for the carpark, I convinced Lachlan and Corey to come with me through Dogleg Cave. The cave is a short, rocky streamway that twists and crawls through several S-bends before terminating in a sand trap. The sand trap is much like a sump, but filled with sand instead of water. Somewhere beneath the sand is a gate, and somewhere beneath the gate are very beautiful passages. Unfortunately, neither of those are likely to be seen anytime soon. Nonetheless, the sand trap itself was actually quite impressive and not something I’d really expected here, reminiscent of a sea cave or a little quiet oasis in a rocky desert. Noting that there were only one or two pairs of kneedpads between three cavers and the entrance was 15 minutes of crawling back over gravel, the sand was an oasis in more ways than one. \n\nBack at camp, everyone was ‘caved out’ – it had been a great weekend. No stamina remained for the little creek/canyon that was meant to be in the area. Earmarking that for next time, our convoy of cars filed back towards Canberra – the scaling poles rattling gleefully in one of them all the way home.\n\n\f"

    "body": "This was our first club trip in almost 4 months. We decided to do some dry canyons in the Blue Mountains since it was far too cold to be swimming and most all caving locations in NSW were shut from either the fires or COVID. We went up Friday night and quickly discovered that every man and his dog(s) had also decided this was the weekend for the Blue Mountains, presumably a side-effect of being stuck inside for so long. The campground we’d planned on using was full to the brim, so we went another 20 minutes (away from the canyons) and found an overflow campground that was also pretty chockers, but enough space for us. Our neighbours had the ingenious idea of leaving their engine running most of the night for heating - thankfully I had earplugs.\n\nOn Saturday we headed up to Tiger Snake canyon. The drive there gave a taste for the kind of scenery to expect – burnt trees as far as the eye could see. As we approached the turnoff to the canyon, a convoy of 4 cars came up behind making us a little worried about a potential traffic jam inside the canyon. But they had a quick look at the signs and decided they weren’t up for a 3km walk, never mind a canyon. The walk to the canyon was quite pleasant ridge-walking and very open, but there was a distinct lack of the colour green. There was some regrowth, but also lots of plants with no regrowth at all. Tiger Snake canyon really shouldn’t be open yet if we want the vegetation to properly recover.\n \nAnyway, we got down to the first pitch and found it to be quite technical. It involved bridging out about 5m while on rope before lowering yourself and hoping not to pendulum back into the slot and get stuck. It had me a wee-bit worried about the rest of the canyon, but the next pitches all proved to be less challenging. I was expecting Lachie to get very wet on the second pitch, but he showed off some impressive balancing skills across a log to remain dry. The third pitch brought us out of the slot, so we returned to bushwalking much to Michael’s disappointment. We had lunch in the sun before finding our way to the next pitch. The obvious rigging point was a tree we didn’t trust as it was badly burnt so we did a little exploration for another way in. Michael was the first down and found out that this was a pitch for headtorches. The pitch descended into a mesmerising snaking slot that was 10-20m tall but only 1-3m wide and wiggled and winded it’s way for at least 50m lengthwise. Definitely the most spectacular part of the canyon for me. Given the lack of light and constricted walls it felt somewhat cave-like. We emerged from the slot and were greeted by some fairly thick bush-bashing before finding our gully for exiting the canyon. The walk out wasn’t too bad except for one climb over crumbly and loose rocks that had me petrified, but I think that’s just my fear of heights – the others didn’t seem to have much trouble.\n\nThe second night was a whole lot colder than the first, the inside of Brit’s tent flap frosted over within an hour of opening it in the morning. The cold meant we had a much slower morning but were still on the road by 8.30am heading towards Juggler’s canyon. The road got progressively worse and we ended up parking around 1km before the actual parking lot as we were driving at pretty much a walking pace anyway. The track was in very good condition all the way to the canyon and the vegetation was all unburnt which was a pleasant contrast to yesterday. The first pitch was absolutely picturesque – water trickling down the multicoloured rocks with ferns and an abundance of greenery all round. It set the tone for the rest of the canyon as the trickling creek and luscious plants continued throughout. We abseiled down a slide that jumped over a ledge with a 3m drop, then abseiled through a rocky outcrop before arriving at a much larger 20m-ish drop. Michael went first and discovered (a bit late) that he had to walk through chest high water. Not ideal in the middle of the water, he was absolutely freezing. Meanwhile Chris had gone walkabout as he often does and had come across another rigging point. There was a resounding yes from Michael when inquired as to whether we should relocate the rope, and the rest of us had a quite spectacular 30m abseil and didn’t get wet. Luckily, we soon emerged into some blazing sunlight meaning Michael was no longer hypothermic. \n\nThe rest of the canyon continued to be absolutely beautiful but was much less eventful. We had lunch at the intersection of Juggler’s and Grand Canyon before jumping on the main track and walking past gawking tourists. We made a bit of a fool of ourselves by going off-track early but soon found the way back to the cars which was a super obvious path, although a little bit steep. After arriving at the cars we packed up in record time, I barely had time to get changed. To top the trip off we did a little side trip to see the stunning views from Point Pilcher. That rounder off a very enjoyable canyoning trip, I’m keen to get out to the Blue Mountains again.\n\f"

After a forecast of rain, the day was surprisingly crisp and clear (although it did rain while we were underground!). \n\nUnfortunately we didn’t get off to the greatest start. Lachie and Andy went ahead to do the rigging, leaving Chris and Mia to realise just a fraction too late that they had no idea where the cave entrance was. There were three possible paths from the carpark. Of course it turned out to be down the last path we tried. Third time lucky. \n\nEventually there, we experienced an impressive 50m pitch, some excellent tunnelling and beautiful chambers. We were unable to do the second and third pitches because of increasing foul air, although I suspect some of us didn’t mind too much (Mia, wondering whether she’d have the stamina to get back up even the first pitch, Andy because of an unfortunate incident involving the spraying of bat excrement up near his collar bone). The ascent proved a little tricky for one unexperienced in the art of rebelays, but with a mighty effort on the part of all involved, experienced and novice cavers alike emerged intact and feeling accomplished.\n\n\f"

We made it to the carpark around 1700.\n\nOnce there, we set up the abseiling gear to practice some ropework. We picked a pitch on Hogans Wall and practiced a bit of rigging, knots, and descending on rope. After that we packed and move towards the camp, where we cooked, some ate a lot of food prepared by others, took showers and then we went to the tents practicing social distancing.\n\n*Day 2. Deua National Park*\n\nStarting at 0700 we dismantled the camp and headed towards Berlang Campground in Deua National Park. We stopped in Braidwood to have a quick breakfast on the way. At Berlang we met with Chris’s family who joined us for the walk.\n\nWe started fording the Shoalhaven River, and after a quick re-setup we started walking towards Marble Arch passing by The Big Hole. After a Friendly and beautiful flat walk in the middle of the bush we got inside Marble Arch, where we had lunch, and some went to explore other small caves inside.\n\nAfter lunch we had fun around the rock formations of the creek for a while before heading back to the carpark. Once re-grouped at Berlang, we headed to Canberra and made it to the city at 1800.\n\n\f"

    "body": "It’s 6:30am and here I was standing outside ANU Sport in what felt like -5 degree weather. In comes decision one of the day; take Lachie’s car with the check engine light on, or take Oxana’s little (and low to the ground) hatchback. Hatchback it is. One and a half hours later, here we were standing on the edge of a quite rugged dirt road as Oxana’s car sat perched on the top of a hill, one wheel in the air, tyres spinning. However, with a couple of attempts, and admirable skill on Oxana’s part, we safely made it to the carpark where we would start the walk out to the Long Gully Canyon.\n\nAfter a short walk that aided in bringing our body temperatures up above freezing, we reached the first abseil. However, after searching the area high and low for an anchor and coming up empty, out came the trip notes: “the first abseil is about 8m, with an anchor about 5m back on the left”. The search recommenced – high, low, left, right –... and then we found it. However, was it “5m back on the left” where it was meant to be? No, there it was, sitting at the bottom of the drop. But fear not for we had brought MacGyver. A couple minutes later Michael had thrown a rope around a pointy part of the cliff face, added a couple of rocks on top for some extra safety, and made his way to the bottom of the abseil. We were back in business. *Ed: we used a 5m tape to construct the anchor, but removed it afterwards, as the main option for a natural anchor has very poor abseil dynamics. It needs bolts.*\n\nLucky for us the remaining 8 or so abseils went at lot more smoothly. The next couple of hours were filled with a 56m abseil with stunning views, a few wet shoes, and a lot of scrambling over loose rocks. And although there was fear we would be walking out in the dark after the delay of the first abseil, we had made it down the canyon by lunch. This left us with ample time enjoy the view, soak in the sun, and do a bit of exploring. Perhaps we had too much time, as Oxana and Andy found themselves taking a dip in the freezing cold water to swim across the Shoalhaven (mad respect).\n\nThen suddenly all the fun and games where over. The moment we had been dreading the entire day was upon us. It was time to walk out. It’s safe to say that the 350 vertical meters of elevation over 1km was my least favourite part of the day, however, after much huffing and puffing we were out of the canyon and cruising along back to the carpark. Once there we were greeted by Chris, who had taken a different route out in order to collect Michael’s handy work from the first drop, and carrots were passed around. All in all, it was a great day."

    "body": "Michael’s version: “We went. You guys are soft so we went home.”\n\nLachlan’s version: “We went. Corey, Oxana and I are soft. Michael had fun with his Hydrobot. We went home.”\n\nOxana’s version: “We went. Corey and Lachlan were soft. Michael sweared lots at his tangled rope. Oxana got concerned by both. We went home.”\n\nMichael’s defense: “Michael comes from a family of shearers/farmers. What happened was tame swearing.”\n\nCorey’s version is a little longer...\n\nLachlan, Oxana and I had camped at Mount Fairy overnight after a caving trip the previous day. We met with Michael at Bungonia for our canyon attempt. Being the middle of winter, we were well aware that a wet canyon such as Bungonia Main would be very cold.\n\nDuring the walk in, Lachlan and Michael were discussing wetsuits. The confusing part is that they convinced themselves that springsuits (like the one Lachlan brought for the trip) would be more than warm enough, and Michael’s full wetsuit would be too hot for the trip. While it’s true that Michael is always warmer than the rest of us in canyons, I thought these conclusions were bold.\n\nAfter walking down the gully to the creek and following downstream, it wasn’t long before our first swimming section. We changed into all the warm layers we had (which for most of us was thermals underneath wetsuits). Despite these layers, the water was probably the coldest I had ever been in!\n\nThe first drop was meant to be about 35m. To be on the safe side, we tied our two 70m ropes together. Unfortunately the ropes tangled, and Michael spent a long time trying hard to untangle them at the top of the pitch. After a while, Michael changed tactics and threw (the still very tangled) rope down the pitch, hoping that it would untangle itself.\n\nMichael was first to descend, and about half- way down he stopped. After spending a while half-way down the pitch and shouting some things we couldn’t quite hear up the pitch, he indicated that he was re-ascending the rope. Thankfully, Lachlan had rigged a stone knot at the top, making the ascent straightforward. Apparently, the rope had not magically untangled itself, and untangling it halfway down the pitch was no more successful than untangling at the top of the pitch.\n\nAt this point, both Lachlan and I were too cold to continue through the canyon, and Oxana had become concerned at Michael’s failure to descend the first abseil. It was therefore decided to call the trip off, and return back to the car.\n\nThere were a few learnings from this canyon. Firstly, canyon water in winter is cold (surprise!), so thicker wetsuits and/or spray jackets, as well as continuous movement are needed to stay warm. Secondly, the best rope management technique is to avoid tangling the rope in the first place. But if the rope IS tangled, then it is always easier and safer to untangle the rope before descent- not after!\nSPELEOGRAFFITI Vol.26, No.1 2020"

    "body": "This trip was one of the first trips back out of Canberra after the COVID-19 pandemic cooled down in NSW and things started opening back up again, and as such there was quite some excitement to get back out into the outdoors! Upon learning that MSS and SUSS were planning to head to Wee Jasper for some surface exploration and abseiling, NUCC decided to pitch in a team of its own to help trawl the surface for new caves – but no caving, as the caves at the reserve were temporarily closed for COVID-19. Some exploration of the privately-owned thermal paddock nearby was intended, but the rain and mud excluded us from doing any of that.\n\nUpon arriving at Fitzpatrick Trackhead campground, we ran into the Sydney crews coming back from a wander up to Devil’s Punchbowl and set up camp. After a relaxed lunch at the SUSS/MSS campground and a run- in with the local cave-dog, we decided to again head up towards Devil’s Punchbowl to do some\nabseiling. Having completed some slippery and muddy 4WDing up to the top, we started setting up for the abseil. The cave-dog accompanied us the whole way up, scaring most of us half to death with some acrobatics on the high edge of the punchbowl.\n\nAndy Waddell led us through setting up an anchor on some boulders above the high edge, and we took turns abseiling down and poking noses into the small cave sections at the bottom of the abseil. One of the Sydney members had brought a drone, and got some pretty impressive footage of both the abseiling crews and the doline.\n\nThis dronery was followed by some more surface trogging and some poking of our heads into the bigger caves on our way down to the campsite, but nothing new was found, and we arrived back at camp and started an early campfire while two of the Sydney members drove off to go doorknocking. The hope was that some local landowners would let us go surface trogging on their land, as the majority of caves in the Wee Jasper region are on private property – however in this instance we had no luck finding locals willing to let us run amok on their property.\n\nWe didn’t let this deter us, however, and sat down to an A-grade campfire. Us NUCCers being poor uni students, were not expecting to have any sort of lavish meal beyond our two- minute noodles and pesto penne that night, but fortunately for us one of our Sydney friends surprised us with an absolutely incredible open-fire roast!\n\nThis surprise meal was accompanied by storytelling and getting to know members from the other clubs – a really great example of inter-club bonding and making new connections, as well as perpetuating some amazing oral histories from all clubs.\n\nThe morning after, we again enjoyed a stellar breakfast of bacon and eggs, courtesy of the Sydney clubs. We then ambled up the hill to find more caves – Alan brought his drone out again to search from the air, while the rest of us slogged through rock and blackberry. This time, unlike last afternoon, we did manage to find some entrances! They all looked as if they linked down to Dogleg cave which ran below us, and they were all tagged, but exciting and interesting nonetheless.\n\nWhile this surface slog was occurring, a hopeful crew was sent out to doorknock, but unfortunately they returned a few hours later with the same result as the previous evening. We packed up camp and returned to ANU at about midday."

    "body": "Rising early, the contingent arrived at ANU Sport around 8am, then set off to Bungendore. In Bungendore, we found a nice cafe where we were able to get caffeinated and well-fed, then continued our journey on to the caves. Upon arrival, we changed into caving gear and headed to Main Cave.\n\nValiantly fighting our way through blackberries covering the entrance, we went into the cave, made seats in the mud and readied ourselves for Corey’s presentation. The presentation raised questions like, “Why are caves important?”, “What animals and food sources can be found in caves?” and “Do caver crumbs count as a food source?”. Answers were discussed and written down on small cards with highlighter.\n\nFrom this point, we started exploring the cave. Starting from a relatively easy entrance, the difficulty steadily increased, as did the features to be seen. Stalactites, stalactites, columns and straws. Cafe graffiti dated to the 1970s. Long, slippery, muddy inclines we needed to pull each other up. A tunnel filled with water to crawl through, and an even tighter tunnel you need to crawl through on your back. Sleeping bats. A sump which stretches further than can be seen. And in the final chamber, cave bacon to replenish us.\n\nLeaving the warmth of the cave, we proceeded to have lunch and take part in the next half of Corey’s presentation, where we were able to experiment with chemicals to observe how various rocks dissolve. For those of you playing along at home, chalk and vinegar is a highly recommended combination.\n\nFrom this point, we split into groups to explore different caves. There was an abandoned mineshaft, which was easy to get through, and which looked awesome. We tried finding a cave called Fox Hole (MF12) on our maps. We found this, and in the process at least three of us climbed down a wombat hole thinking that we had the right one. *Ed: It’s Mount Fairy, the wombat holes and caves are interchangeable!*\n\nFor our last cave, we climbed a mountain and saw a hole in the ground. To get through this, we threw a ladder into the hole and began to climb. At the base, there was a good series of chambers with very bright cave formations. With this cave however, the real challenge was getting out. As it turns out, climbing up a swinging ladder through a narrow gap is much harder than climbing down. Nonetheless, we were all successful, and to the best of our knowledge nobody was left behind in the cave.\n\nThe caving being complete for the day, from here we returned to the carpark, sorted out our gear and began the drive back to Canberra."

    "body": "*Scene 1-*\n\nIt’s 4pm on Friday afternoon. Rod S., with minimal fuss, enters his transport and starts the engine. Shortly into the commute a digital sign is witnessed with the words:\n\nIncident on M1 north of Wahroonga, expect delays\n\nRod S. – I’ve got a bad feeling about this.\n\nThe M2 is gridlocked, it would be nearly as quick to get out and walk. Rather than draw attention to himself, Rod S. becomes just another of the mindless masses attempting to escape the Greater Sydney Metropolis.\n\nFive changes of the lights are required just to get onto Pennant Hills Rd. The crawl continues with only occasional, brief, reprieves, never long enough to give any real hope.\n\nAn hour later than scheduled Rod arrives and Jim’s domicile. Equipment is transferred to Jim’s transport and a plan is hatched in an attempt to avoid the crush of the masses heading north. Ducking and weaving through the back streets of Wahroonga, Hornsby, Asquith and Mt Colah, the intrepid travellers join the old Pacific Highway for a smooth run to Berowra. Now north of the incident Jim and Rod S. join the M1 with the hopes of a near- empty freeway, and plunge straight back into gridlock.\n\nTheir speed inevitably increases, but traffic remains heavy. Three hours after departure, Rod meets Jai for the first time at Kariong.\n\nJai – New to MSS and caving, the Kempsey trip is my first non tourist cave trip and I am super pumped\nThe three travellers all settle in to Jim’s transport for the rest of the trip, which remains uneventful. Even the evening meal at Bulahdelah is uneventful, filling the stomach but leaving the taste buds neglected.\n\nThey arrive at the designated meeting point to find most of the others already asleep, so they settle in for the night in preparation for the challenges that await in the\nmorning.\n\n*Scene 2-*\n\nAfter ignoring dawn’s light filtering through the curtained windows for what never feels like long enough *(Ed: that’s because you arrived around midnight!)*, obligation to coordinate the attendees forces Rod S. to rise and face the morning. Rod S. emerges to find the camp already full of activity, so he starts with greetings and introductions.\n\nAt this stage only Oxana and Corey are still en route, but they still have plenty of time as the scheduled meeting time with the locals is not until midday.\n\nOne of the primary objectives for the weekend is to resurvey Moparabah Cave.1 Rod S. approaches Phil M. in regards to this\n\nRod S. – Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to lead the survey of Moparabah.\n\nPhil M. agrees to this much too easily, thus no arm-twisting is required.\n\nAfter a discussion with Phil L., Rod S. addresses the team.\n\nRod S. – At the Spotted Frog, the local cavers, we will meet\n\nThankfully Google Maps hadn’t been updated with the new name for the café formerly known as the Spotted Frog. So Rod S., Jim and Jai found Rod O. and Cathi outside Blueys. Although the name is decidedly less interesting, the burgers are a definite improvement on the previous night’s evening meal.\n\nBy midday most of the cavers have filtered in, including locals Phil L. and Thomas, but Phil M. and Simon were still at a coffee shop somewhere in town, and the burgers were yet to be consumed. The burgers arrive, are eaten, and still no sign of Phil M. and Simon.\n\nPhil L. and Thomas need to take a small detour to retrieve some maps, so they head off with the plan to meet us again further down the road.\n\nAs soon as Phil M. and Simon arrive, the merry band all board their transportation and depart.\n\n*Scene 3-*\n\nJohn Taylor is found just short of the final destination, patiently waiting for everyone else to arrive. He joins the convoy as they approach the first gate and enter private property. Two more gates are passed as the group wind their way through an old match-stick plantation.\n\nThey stop next to a small escarpment covered in lantana, stinging nettles, stinging trees, and other native and introduced vegetation all designed specifically to inflict pain and misery on any foolhardy travellers attempting to enter their domain. With the right mixture of fools and hardy, the cavers skirt the bottom edge of the escarpment before finding a suitable entry point.\n\nAnd there it is, Moparabah Cave. This is the main, lower entry. Various holes amongst the tumble of boulders all appear to lead further into the depths of the hillside, but most are too small to be enterable by humans. Of course, at least one is big enough.\n\nThe initial plan is for Phil L. to take a small group on a quick trip through the cave to familiarise themselves with the basics and then start surveying. It sounds like a good idea, until the small group becomes most of the cavers.\n\nAs the not-so-small group begin their not-so-quick trip through Moparabah, John leads Lachlan, Thomas, Andy and Rod S. onto the escarpment to locate the upper entrances plus another hole that Thomas had looked at previously. Quickly locating Thomas’ hole (*think of better wording here*), Thomas, Andy and Lachlan headed in to see if it would link into the main system. After pointing out that helmets required removal in order to fit through one squeeze, Rod S. opts to remain on the surface with John.\n\nAfter a while, and with Lachlan, Andy and Thomas well into the cave, John and Rod S. decide to go looking for some of the upper entrances to Moparabah. Heading up the hill they quickly locate MP20 and MP2 plus some associated holes. Rod S. finds another hole, but John insists it’s not MP1, the very top hole. Continuing the search yields no results, so Rod S. has another look at the hole he had located. Sure enough, there is the MP1 tag. Apparently the small tree John remembered in the entrance is now two large trees *(Ed: at this point I will respectfully comment while casting no aspersions whatsoever that the two trees are different species)*.\n\nHeading back down the slope John and Rod S. encounter the other three coming up, having not found a\nconnection between Thomas’ hole (*Seriously, think of better wording*) and the main cave. They then started showing Thomas, Lachlan and Andy the other locations when they found Phil L. had emerged from MP1 and is looking for some relief.\n\nSlowly but surely the others began to emerge from MP1, the entrance not being conducive to a rapid departure. There is some talk amongst the emerging cavers regarding their experience.\n\nAndriana - This may be the first time that I have been to a cave in Australia that truly deserves to be described as 'beneath the fig tree'.\n\nJim - The cave is quite maze like and mainly consists of dry small passageways and a few larger chambers.\n\nJai - The main entrance required a crawling start so we were straight into it. Once inside it opened up a bit and the caving experience began. Crawling through a few tight squeezes, negotiating some narrow passages, crawling through the dirt and viewing some beautiful features while trying to dodge the few hundred (if not thousand) bats we had inadvertently tried to avoid! The cave had a bit of everything and seemed to go on forever. Can’t wait for the next one. \n\nRod O. - The character of the cave changes as you progress through it, ranging from squeezes, rifts, chambers and mazes. Side passages run off seemingly everywhere, sometimes joining back onto the main passage deeper into the cave. There are some nice areas of formation, tons of marine fossils along with some interesting bone breccia deposits. The oldest signature found so far is J.P 1/6/1910. The cave is also home to large colonies of Bent Wing and Horseshoe bats.\n\nJim - There is a quite a bit of vertical extent and some tight areas. We were expertly led by local KSS member Phil who obviously has a lot of experience in this cave. This is actually the largest cave in the Macleay River karst.\n\nTrish - 2 hours underground, being bashed by bats, finding fossilised remains (hopefully not a previous caver) and finally a series of squeezes and turns to be birthed at the top of the cave. Great times. Can't wait to do it again.\n\nJim - This cave has a significant population of Eastern Bent Wing Bats. Our attempts to avoid them had failed or maybe Phil was wrong about them being in a particular chamber. The passages were soon engulfed by these flying mammals, certainly like nothing I had experienced before. It just so happened that the girl in front of me was freaked out by these bats movements. She resorted to getting down on hands and knees, head down eyes partly closed to avoid their presence. This was quite an event as some of the bats were deflecting off my clothes and one was momentarily caught on my shirt. Others even had the bats go inside their helmet and clothes. With my open eyes this was all quite a unique experience from these Bat storms.\n\nMeanwhile Andy, Lachlan and Thomas regale the emerging cavers with the exploits of the above ground group.\n\nThomas – We peeled off up the hill to relocate MP34. Without much difficulty we were successfully gathered around the entrance and preparing for entry, with the hopes that the extra eyes may locate further passage that could potentially connect with the main cave system, given its proximity amongst the other known entrances. A second question to this quest was to also assess the viability of mapping this system by the more experienced than myself. Whenever I'd sat down to try and translate memory to mud map it would just become a drawing in the shape of one big confusing twistie stood on its end.\n\nAndy - John, Rod Smith, Tom, Lachlan and I climbed into MP34 and had to bypass a rather large spider. The cave turned out to be a bit of a squeeze, with some nice formation here and there. Unfortunately we couldn't connect it up with main cave, which was our objective, so we hopped out and continued with the day.\n\nLachlan - It was one of those sort caves where everything wants to rip you, and there’s not enough space to avoid getting shredded. We barreled down to the bottom of the cave, leaving Rod and John on the surface to swap stories (and eventually get bored and wander off). Here there were a few enjoyably nasty leads that were all too tight or impenetrably filled with mud. There was also a rather fat brushtail possum. I tried rescuing it, but it declined to be rescued, and wandered off through a slot that was far too tight for me to fit through. Considering that not only was it fat, but it was also uninjured, I suspect that there’s another entrance to MP34 somewhere. Tom hopes that MP34 connects to Main Cave, and the possum makes me suspect he’s right. It’s also right over the top of the course of Main Cave according to the GPS. If the cave ever needs a name, Andy and I would like to suggest Possum’s Palace. There’s more of MP34 down a climb covered by a nice flowstone cascade. But by the time Andy and I got there, we were pretty filthy and didn’t want to grot up the formation. So need to go back with a clean tape and detrog...\n\nThomas - Andy and Lachlan began the bumpy descent before me. Once we had reached what we shall call the bottom of the cave for now, the pushing and poking of other branches began, though to little avail. What I found very interesting at one stage was the reflection of a red eye catching my own, scampering away up a slope to the left of Lachlan. Disappearing through a squeeze more suited to possums than people was a Brushtail.\n\nBy my rough guess we'd have had to been around 30 vertical metres below the entry, not to mention the twists, turns, slopes and squeezes between. A lot deeper in than I'd have ever expected to find a possum. Either its presence suggests a connection to an easier access through the tunnel where I last saw it enter or it's just exceptional at navigating in the pitch dark. Or a third possibility I suppose could be that it was in fact too deep and was extremely lost and that we fumbled that cave rescue.\n\nAndy - I poked my head into a couple of holes just near MP2. One barely went further than a couple of meters. But another was a bit more interesting. A climb through a rock pile, and down a slit took me about 10-15m into the cave. Once jammed in at the bottom of the slit I was too large to orient myself to see what was underneath, and if it went further, so I turned around. Perhaps someone else smaller than me can give it another look.\n\nHaving been underground for a few hours, most people feel like doing the return journey above ground, but Phil L. says he would prefer the subterranean route as it is quicker. Grasping their opportunity for a trip through the main cave, Lachlan, Andy and Thomas quickly follow Phil L.\n\nAndy and Lachlan were excited by the opportunity.\n\nAndy - Phil took us back through the cave and out the entrance. Man there were a lot of bats! It was quite an interesting cave.\n\nLachlan - Phil Lardner offered to take anyone who wanted back down though Main Cave, so Andy, Tom and I set off with him. It is a cracking bit of cave, and it’s going to be a big survey project. The volume of bats in it was kinda worrying though, I think a reasonable chunk of the cave is going to have to be nocturnal surveying.\n\nThe group return to their transportation where a discussion follows ensuring everyone knows where and when to meet the following day, and the scene fades out ...\n\n*Scene 4-*\n\nToday a slightly smaller group arrives at the café formally known as The Spotted Frog in a much timelier manner, Dave and Marilyn both opting out due to not feeling well. However, John is again kept waiting as Phil L. decides to play tour guide during the drive out, stopping numerous times to point out various locations of interest to Rod S. and Rod O., and anyone else in earshot.\n\nArriving back at Moparabah the cavers are better organized into groups. Phil M. leads the first group to start surveying Moparabah from the main entrance. Lachlan takes the second group to the top entrance to begin surveying from there. The third group heads beyond Moparabah to look at some of the other caves in the area.\n\nThe third group, consisting of John, Phil L., Thomas, Rod S., Rod O., Cathi, Jim, Trish and Jai, make their way up the escarpment. Soon the group fragments with Phil L., Thomas and Jai checking out some squeezy holes and the rest passing Lachlan’s survey team setting up at MP1 before arriving at MP11??? This is a small cave with a couple of entrances through rockpile and into some lower chambers. The farthest extent of the cave is barely out of earshot from the surface. \n\nThe group of cavers then moved on to MP23??? which is more extensive then MP11??? A vertical climb leads to a sloping passage running into the main, decorated chamber. The chamber extends to the left and right with what looks like possible leads, although they probably require rock removal to actually get anywhere. Straight on there is a\nsqueeze that leads further into the cave. Jim is the only member of the group to explore further into the cave, but, according to the map, he didn’t find his way to the furthest reaches.\n\nThe group return to the transportation where lunch is stowed in order to consume their midday repast, well after midday. Rod S., Rod O. and Cathi then decide to acquaint themselves with the Sebastapol area, ably guided by John.\n\n*Scene 5-*\n\nSebastapol is a National Parks managed area and, as such, the cavers don’t have permission to go underground. They do, however, have permission to walk the surface, so that is the plan. One of the first they visit is the efflux, where soon a rotten animal smell permeates the air. It seems to be coming from the cave itself, maybe something has fallen in.\n\nAs they turn to leave John sees a snake and immediately moves away before realising the red-bellied black snake is obviously the source of the foul aroma. The cavers move quickly past, not because of any danger to their lives, just their olfactory organs.\n\nMoving further up the hill they continue to look for other tagged features, while trying to avoid the worst of the lantana and other annoying vegetation. Rod S., the only one in shorts, sits out one particularly nasty section in an area that reminds Cathi and Rod O. of Bullita, only on a smaller scale.\n\nThe last feature visited is Daylight Cave. This is named because of the hole in the roof that provides daylight into the first chamber in the cave. The entrance is a scramble down a slope but it would be possible to also enter via the daylight hole as it is quite large, but would require SRT as it is also quite vertical. Being quite a large feature it leaves the visiting cavers wondering why no other similarly sized features have been found.\n\n*Scene 6-*\n\nWith a different destination planned, a different meeting place is organized, so the café formally known as the Spotted Frog didn’t witness the arrival of a group of cavers transportation. Again a large, but not full, compliment of cavers meet for a visit to Yessabah. John had opted out for the day as it was the wrong direction for him travelling home. Oxana, Corey, Andy, Kirra and Andriana all decide to get an earlier start for the homeward trip, as they are all aiming to be in Canberra by evening. Before leaving they reflected on their weekend.\n\nAndy - Kirra, Oxana, Andriana, Lachlan and I started to map the cave from MP1. It was a very slow process as we were still relatively new to mapping, and some of us were learning for the first time. The cave was a lot more complex than we had expected. It was\ninteresting to be able to see so much more of the cave while mapping it, than if we had just passed through at speed.\n\nAndriana - I had a lot of fun learning how to survey over the weekend, and only wish that we hadn't gotten the bats so upset!\n\nYessabah is the site of an old quarry, which had removed some of the limestone. There’s still plenty left with a good number of predominantly small caves over the hillside. Some of the cavers head directly for the old quarry, whereas some\ndecide to follow Phil L. round to the left and then up the side of the hill.\n\nThe group following Phil L. don’t move very fast, primarily so they can stop at any feature and have a good look, including entering the position on various GPS’. This allows a few more cavers to catch up, but still not the entire group.\n\nAnd then, it happens. Simon didn’t see the sapling stinging tree with the single leaf. That single leaf smears across his left thigh as he walks past, and the pain is immediate. Numerous profanities issue forth from between gritted teeth. Not wanting to get stung himself, and in a strange sense of revenge, Rod S. uses his footwear to remove the stinging tree from any conceivable human path.\n\nAfter investigating the immediate area, and not wanting to separate the group any further, the decision is made to return to the bottom of the hill. Thankfully, Simon, despite the pain, is able to walk down the hill unaided and soon the majority of cavers area sitting in a shady spot in front of the old quarry.\n\nLooking up it is just possible to see the tiny dots of Rod O. and Cathi on the highest reaches of the quarry. Simon, with Phil M. and Lachlan who all travelled to Yessabah in Phil M.’s transport, depart in order to find some\nherbal remedies for Simon’s thigh. The rest, not wanting to all leave while two cavers would be unaware of what’s happening, discuss options. Dave and Marilyn, since they are staying in the Kempsey area for another day, offer to wait for Cathi and Rod O. to return. The others accept the offer and return to their transportation.\n\nRod O. - Cathi spent most of the morning, in her element, wandering around the old quarry.\n\nWhen Cathi and Rod O. return they are given the story by Dave and Marilyn. In response to Simon’s experience with the stinging tree, Cathi replies.\n\nCathi - Rod got whacked by one too on our way down the hill (and there was much swearing), but as usual he brushes these things off.\n\n*Scene 7-*\n\nFor Jim, Jai and Rod S. the return trip to Sydney involved a recommended stop at Riccardoes Tomatoes near Port Macquarie. A very popular spot with travelers due to the quality of tomato and strawberry they produce.\n\nThe rest of the journey is much like the trip to Kempsey, but in reverse. The fast flowing trip becomes a snail’s pace around Gosford and the mindless masses return from their long weekend travels.\n\nMeanwhile Phil L. is taking Phil M., Simon, Lachlan, Marilyn and Dave to the coast to show them a sea cave. Phil M. summarised the experience.\n\nPhil M. - We got to the beach on Monday afternoon and looked at a big sea cave but there was a bit too much wave action to swim into it.\n\nMarilyn, on the other hand, goes into more detail.\n\nMarilyn - After we’d finished our caving exploration on Monday (and most people had left to travel home), Phillip offered to take us (those of us who’d decided to stay an extra day) on another adventure. A SEA CAVE!\n\nWe drove down to Gap Beach, and started walking across the beach over to the rocks. \"Just up here\"\nsays Phillip, it was a jungle of Lantana, Pandanus, and Lomandra - all of which were scratchy and spiky, and the Crocs I was wearing weren't coping. Not to mention that it was very snaky and I didn't wear my gaiters,- what was I thinking? Fortunately we stopped and Phillip said, \"I'm sure there is a track on the hill\", and sure enough we stumbled onto it. And then another cove appeared - it was like Treasure Island! We dropped down into the cove and there was another lovely campsite, with plenty of fire wood. Then we headed over to the slot that we could see from above.\n\nSadly, although it was low tide, it wasn’t low enough to jump in and check out the slot. But Phillip took us up the rocks, and over to a natural bridge over the top of the slot which we used down to get back onto the rock platform, and there voila was this stunning cave – which had a back entry that we couldn’t see, but it apparently joined up with out slot. We all agreed that this was a place that we HAD to revisit, preferably with lower tide, plus snorkeling or diving gear! Great adventure, thanks Phillip.\n\nAnd finish with the cliché, although apt, “Top Trip”"
