A small group of foolhardy NUCCers decided that they weren't content to wait for presents in two days time and that they wanted to go caving instead. So we trooped off to Wee J for a poke around in Punchbowl Cave. Many bats were found, no interesting mud sculptures were observed, and Chris could not be enticed to carry a cavepack full of kit to Loxin Wall for mostly no reason (as neither Britt nor Lachie turned out that keen to climb it anyway). wHowever Chris' shiny new Scurion did turn out to be useful, as we could see formation on the roof that none of us ever knew even existed...

We failed to find any new cave, as anywhere we went previous generations of NUCC or CSS would have been there anyway. However, we did find one speculative point that needs the scaling poles lurking in the store-room deployed against it. Saved for another time...
