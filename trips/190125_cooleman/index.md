We met up with ROC and SUSS and had a great 3 days of caving over the Australia day long weekend.We stayed at the Yarrangobilly River Campground on the first night near Yagby Caves and then went on to the Magpie Flat campground at Cooleman Plain.This was near a gorgeous gorge with many surrounding caves.
